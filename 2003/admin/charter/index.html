              <strong>Preface</strong><br>
              This document outlines the rules and regulations that govern the 
              AustNet IRC network. It represents the wills and support of a mass 
              majority of the AustNet community (users, opers and admins alike). 
              It discusses the policy and guidelines which are enforced on the 
              network, educating and promoting proper network usage. </p>
            <p align="left"><img src="../../images/dot_orange.gif" width="8" height="8"> 
              <strong>Operators</strong></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p align="left"> <img src="../../images/dot_dblue.gif" width="6" height="6"> 
                Use of /KILL should be limited to providing a quick disruption 
                of a broken or errored client or one that is flooding or breaking 
                server rules or abusing other servers/clients. This includes or 
                could include a K:Line (local) or G:Line (network wide). </p>
              <p align="left"><img src="../../images/dot_dblue.gif" width="6" height="6"> 
                Client disconnection from the network is substantiated when: <br>
                - violation of organisation charter agreement occurs <br>
                - disruption of user's ability to IRC (harassing) <br>
                - abuse of services or channel takeovers <br>
                - flooding or clonebots <br>
                - deliberate ban evasions <br>
                - damage to servers, connections or physical hardware </p>
              <p align="left"><img src="../../images/dot_dblue.gif" width="6" height="6"> 
                Use of /SQUIT should be used only to reroute a server or in some 
                cases jupe a server in co-operation or support of other online 
                IRC-operators or admins.</p>
              <p align="left"><img src="../../images/dot_dblue.gif" width="6" height="6"> 
                Before using /SQUIT, an operator is required to <br>
                - WALLOP the reroute with the online operators <br>
                - /msg $.austnet.org to inform the general community. </p>
              <p align="left"><img src="../../images/dot_dblue.gif" width="6" height="6"> 
                Online operators are expected to have general knowledge about 
                IRC; if a user asks a question (basic help), operators are expected 
                to politely attempt to help. If you find you are otherwise occupied, 
                feel free to forward clients to #Help.</p>
              <p align="left"><img src="../../images/dot_dblue.gif" width="6" height="6"> 
                In the case of reroute or deliberate service interference, operators 
                should /msg $*.austnet.org (or relevant server masks) in order 
                to notify clients of the upcomming events. </p>
              <p align="left"><img src="../../images/dot_dblue.gif" width="6" height="6"> 
                General abuse or hassles with operators or servers should be presented 
                to the server's administrator, and/or the abuse response unit 
                (abuse@austnet.org). </p>
              <p align="left"><img src="../../images/dot_dblue.gif" width="6" height="6"> 
                An operator can have only one primary O-line at a time. This is 
                considered to be their main server, and the one they use the most. 
                This is also the person who is responsible for their duties. </p>
              <p align="left"><img src="../../images/dot_dblue.gif" width="6" height="6"> 
                An operator, however, can have as many secondaries as desired. 
                These are not listed in server MOTD's and the operator must help 
                the admin/oper contact maintain an accurate list of primaries 
                and secondaries. </p>
              <p align="left"><img src="../../images/dot_dblue.gif" width="6" height="6"> 
                Operators are considered network staff. As such, they may change 
                primary O lines with the consent and prior notification to admin@austnet.org 
                by the admin adding the operator to their staff, and no objection 
                by another administrator within 48 hours. If there is an objection 
                by another server administrator, a vote must be called. </p>
              <p align="left"><img src="../../images/dot_dblue.gif" width="6" height="6"> 
                Operators coming in with a server that then delinks will lose 
                their O line unless approval and a move occurs within 7 days of 
                the server delinking. In the event of a vote, no operator who 
                has a current vote pending (including the operator who is the 
                subject of the vote), may vote to ensure fairness.</p>

                and is subject to your vote participation. Voting will be handled

                Anyone on the vote roll who does not vote for 3 votes in a row, 
                may be subject to removal from that vote roll. (exceptions are

                each and every vote, as most are often close, therefore having 
                inactive voting members wastes time in having to call revotes.

                Only those with level 300 access to AustNet services may place 
                a vote, however admins may approach one of these people to request 
                a vote for an issue they feel needs addressing. <br>
                When a vote is placed, VoteOP will send a 'note' to all members 
                on the voteroll, and an email shall be sent to the AustNet general 
                mailing list [austnet@austnet.org] advising of this. <br>
                Members on the voteroll shall place their vote before the vote 
                closing date.<br>
                When the vote closes, any votes made will be processed, a summary 
                shall be posted to the AustNet general mailing list, and full 
                vote details will be made available on AustNet's website.</p>

                only by the YES and NO votes. A clear 50% or higher majority is 
                required either way. <br>
                In event of a vote not having any clear outcome, a revote shall 
                be called in 1 weeks time. This revote shall not allow any abstain 
                votes to be made (to try to force some type of majority towards 
                YES or NO). <br>
