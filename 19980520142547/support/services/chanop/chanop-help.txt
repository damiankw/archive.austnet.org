Post: RogerY Date: Sun Oct 5 Subject: Services Changes
  - Registration sequence changed. Requires acknowledgment now via YES.
    Also gives information pertaining to spamming, mass inviting.
  - Command addition: /msg ChanOP YES <#chan>   This is used to complete
    the registration of a channel (a way to acknowledge they have read
    the policies)
  - INVITE modified so you can only invite yourself. This was because
    many people were abusing it, to mass invite. Anyone know a better
    way to handle this problem? :)
  - LISTBAN heavily modified.
      /msg ChanOP listban <#chan> <switches> <mask>
      Switches include: -whoset      (who set the ban)
                        -whenset     (when was ban set)
                        -reason      (what was the ban reason)
      Listban is limited to 15 queries returned if you use '*' mask. You
      can get around this by doing '*@*' mask :)
  - TOPIC changed. Random topic has a cookie installed :-) You have a
    1 in 25 chance of this cookie turning up. Lets see who finds it first
    :)
  - BAN heavily modified.
      /msg ChanOP ban <#chan> <nick>|<mask> <switches> <reason>
      Switches include: -level <level> (min level to remove ban)
                        -hours <numb>  (hours till expires)
                        -mins <numb>   (mins till expires)
                        -noexpire      (never expire)
                        -nokick        (ban, but don't kick)
  - SYNTAX command addition
      /msg ChanOP syntax <command>  gives you brief syntax summary.
  - SET #chan TELLADD <on|off>    added (owner gets note on adduser)
  - Max suspend for a user is 1month (delete user if you want it longer).
  - Modelock rewritten. hehe uses 500 less lines :P You can now modelock
    arguments too. ie +k key  and  +l limit 
  - If a chan is modelock +i, +k then chanop will boot anyone out that
    recreates it (ie so they do not see key, or in there when +i etc)
  - Ban handling fixed to avoid auto rejoin loops.
  - URL's now buffered, saves bandwidth :)
  - Database system rewritten.

specified level may change it.  Also, if ChanOP is re-started or
re-creates the channel, it will remember your last topic and place
it back on the channel.  Use level of 0 to deactivate enforcement.
It doesn't matter what level you use, ChanOP will always remember any
topic placed on.

You may not use mode b or o or v, these are set using
the BAN/UNBAN, OP/DEOP/AOP and AOV commands.

Protect is used as a way of preventing channel takeovers.  A 
protected user cannot be kicked by a user of lower channel level
than themselves.  It also protects themselves from being banned
or having channel operator status removed from them.  However, due
to fact that databases are stored by nicks only, it is difficult to
protect users on channel bans.  Use the /MSG ChanOP UNBAN command to
remove a ban on you.

*** Command Syntax ***
   Syntax: SETUSER <#chan> <nick> PROTECT <on/off>
   Access: Requires 150 level channel access.
