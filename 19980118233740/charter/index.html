Revision 2.02<br>
</center>

<br><b>Preface</b><hr>


  This document outlines the rules and regulations that govern the austnet.
  It represents the wills and support of a mass majority of the austnet
  community (users, opers and admins alike).  It discusses the policy and
  guidelines which are enforced on the network, educating and promoting
  proper network usage.<br><br>

<br><b>Operators</b><hr>

<ul><li><font size=2>
Use of /KILL should be limited to providing a quick disruption
of a broken or erroed client or one that is flooding or breaking
server rules or abusing other servers/clients.  This includes or
could include a K:Line (local) or G:Line (network wide).
</font></li></ul>

<ul><li><font size=2>
Client disconnection from the network is substantiated when:
<ul>
<li>     violation of organisation charter agreement occurs</li>
<li>     disruption of user's ability to IRC (harassing)</li>
<li>     abuse of services or channel takeovers</li>
<li>     flooding or clonebots</li>
<li>     deliberate ban evasions</li>
<li>     damage to servers, connections or physical hardware</li>
</ul>
</font></li></ul>

<ul><li><font size=2>
    Use of /SQUIT should be used only to reroute a server or in some
     cases jupe a server in co-operation or support of other online
     irc-operators or admins.
</font></li></ul>

<ul><li><font size=2>
    Before using /SQUIT, an operator is required to a) WALLOP the
     reroute with the online operators and b) /msg $<mask>.austnet.org
     to inform the general community.
</font></li></ul>

<ul><li><font size=2>
   Online operators are expected to have general knowledge about
     irc; if a user askes a question (basic help), operators are
     expected to politely attempt to help.  If you find you are
     otherwise occupied, feel free to forward clients to #Help.
</font></li></ul>

<ul><li><font size=2>
    In the case of reroute or deliberate service interference,
     operators should /msg $*.org (or relevant server masks) in
     order to notify clients of the upcomming events.
</font></li></ul>

<ul><li><font size=2>
    General abuse or hassles with operators or servers should be
     presented to the server's administrator, and/or the Network
     Administration (admin@austnet.org)
</font></li></ul>

<ul><li><font size=2>
    An operator can have only one primary O:line at a time. This is
     considered to be their main server, and the one they use the most.
     This is also the person who is responsible for their duties.
</font></li></ul>

<ul><li><font size=2>
    An operator, however, can have as many secondaries as desired.
     These are not listed in server MOTD's and the operator must help
     the admin/oper contact maintain an accurate list of primaries
     and secondaries.
</font></li></ul>

<br><b>Server Administrators</b><hr>

<ul><li><font size=2>
    The owners/admins of IRC servers are required to keep their
     server on-line to the requirements of server applications.
</font></li></ul>

<ul><li><font size=2>
    They are required to maintain and housekeep their server,
     upgrading the daemon when required and ensuring that the server
     is running at optimum performance.
</font></li></ul>

<ul><li><font size=2>
    Report outages, connectivity upgrades or the like to the
     Routing Department (routing@austnet.org)
</font></li></ul>

<ul><li><font size=2>
    Server Administrators are required to give Network Administration
     prior knowledge of O:line generation on servers at least 48
     hours before hand.  This is for administrative purposes, and
     so mail aliases, server information and the appropriate resources
     can be modified.  This too, serves as a method of monitoring
     the operator count network wide and the ability for discussion
     over the O:line.
</font></li></ul>

<ul><li><font size=2>
    It is the responsibility of admins to see that their operators get
     the training required to perform well.
</font></li></ul>

<ul><li><font size=2>
    Any more than four O:lines (primary) on a server is highly
     discouraged unless there is a serious problem on the server
     that requires futher monitoring. 
</font></li></ul>

<ul><li><font size=2>
    Server Administrators are required to organise connection lines
     with the Routing Department (routing@austnet.org)
</font></li></ul>

<ul><li><font size=2>
    The Server Admin is able to upgrade the server's machine or link,
     providing the machine remains in the same location, net-wise,
     or making other changes as necessary in keeping his or her server
     in the best possible working condition, where "best possible
     working condition" is defined at the discretion of the Admin.
</font></li></ul>

<ul><li><font size=2>
    Setting up an additional server to expand the capability of the 
     site, even if this includes running additional processes on 
     different machines, providing that the machines are of comparably
     capability, and the server's location does not change. 
</font></li></ul>

<ul><li><font size=2>
    Do whatever is necessary regarding his or her own server, to be
     decided at the Admin's discretion, to make a smooth transition 
     during hardware or software upgrades, or during an emergency 
     situation. 
</font></li></ul>

<ul><li><font size=2>
    An admin is responsible for the actions of their operators. If an
     operator causes problems which the admin cannot or will not deal
     with, the admin/oper contact will ask the admin to suspend the oper
     until the matter can be resolved.
</font></li></ul>

<br><b>Services Operators</b><hr>

<ul><li><font size=2>
   Network Operators (100 service access) should attempt to mediate
    problems such as channel takeovers and channel floods, using the
    SETMODE and WIPECHAN commands.
</font></li></ul>
<ul><li><font size=2>
   Issuing operator status to certain users should be done *only*
    when a channel has lost ops for a reason *and* channel users are
    unhappy about it *and* they have decided upon who is to be opped.
</font></li></ul>
<ul><li><font size=2>
   A WIPECHAN should be used when a channel has been locked and set
    to +pstmil 1 or such similar mechanism (such as +b *!*@*) *and*
    channel regulars complain about it.  In this case, the channel
    has to be cleared and nothing else.  Ops will be decided as usual
    by the person who joins the channel first.
</font></li></ul>
<ul><li><font size=2>
   Service Operators (200 service access) are required to assist
    users in the legitimate recovery of passwords to their nickname.
</font></li></ul>
<ul><li><font size=2>
   Service Operators, in the case of channel or service abuse, are
    required to use the SUSPEND command to stop the management of a
    certain channel temporarily.
</font></li></ul>
<ul><li><font size=2>
   Channel suspension or removal as a disciplanary action should be
    posted to services@austnet.org as well to inform the network
    of channel management modifications.
</font></li></ul>
<ul><li><font size=2>
   Service Operators reserve the right to remove channel registrations
    when services have been abused.  This is most likely the case when
    an operator on a channel registers the channel, and they are not
    supported by the current fellow operators.  This is considered a
    channel takeover and should be investigated in depth.
</font></li></ul>
<ul><li><font size=2>
   All IRC-Operators are not subject to addition of service access.
</font></li></ul>

<br><b>Voting Policy</b><hr>

<ul><li><font size=2>
     <b>Vote Roll</b><br>
       All AustNet Admins and global IrcOp's are given the option to vote for issues
       as they arise. Voting is a priviliage, and is subject to your vote
       participation. Voting will be handled by AustNet's vote server <b>VoteOP</b>
</font></li></ul>

<ul><li><font size=2>
     <b>Vote Participation</b><br>
       Anyone on the vote roll who does not vote for 3 votes in a row, may
       be subject to removal from that vote roll. (exceptions are those who
       are known to be away for a period of time). We need each and every
       vote, as most are often close, therefore having inactive voting
       members wastes time in having to call revotes.
</font></li></ul>

<ul><li><font size=2>
     <b>Vote Procedure</b><br>
       Only those with level 300 access to AustNet services may place a vote,
       however admins may approach one of these people to request a vote for
       an issue they feel needs addressing.<p>

       When a vote is placed, VoteOP will send a 'note' to all members on
       the voteroll, and an email shall be sent to the AustNet general
       mailing list [austnet@austnet.org] advising of this.<p>

       Members on the voteroll shall place their vote before the vote closing
       date.<p>

       When the vote closes, any votes made will be processed, a summary
       shall be posted to the AustNet general mailing list, and full vote
       details will be made available on AustNet's website.
</font></li></ul>

<ul><li><font size=2>
     <b>Vote Results</b><br>
       Any abstain's made in a vote shall not be taken into account when
       deciding what the majority was. A votes outcome is determined only
       by the YES and NO votes. A clear 50% or higher majority is required
       either way.<p>

       In event of a vote not having any clear outcome, a revote shall be
       called in a weeks time. This revote shall not allow any abstain
       votes to be made (to try to force some type of majority towards
       YES or NO).<p>

       In the event of a revote being a tie, the CEO shall decide the outcome
       of that vote.
</font></li></ul>

<ul><li><font size=2>
     <b>Vote scenarios</b><br>
     <u>Testlink vote</u>:<br>
  <ul><li>On event of a YES, server shall be given permanent AustNet
          server status.</li>
      <li>On event of a NO, server shall be delinked and may re-apply to
          be a server on AustNet after a period of waiting 2 weeks.</li></ul>

     <u>o: to O: vote</u>:
  <ul><li>On event of a YES, admin has support of network to modify
          the persons o: into an O:. However, this is still the admins
          choice, and may choose not to do that immediatly. Admin may
          remove o:/O: lines anytime they wish without need for votes.</li>
      <li>On event of a NO, admin is given option of leaving the person
          as an o: for a while (as the admin does not have the network
          support to upgrade that status). Admin may choose to drop
          that person as an o: too. A vote may not be called regarding
          that person's oper status until a period of 2 weeks has passed.</li></ul>
</font></li></ul>
