			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="left">#AVA is one of our unique features of AustNet, AustNet&#8217;s virus help channel.</p>
<p align="left">#AVA was first registered Sat Oct 31 1998 and has been going strong ever since.</p>
<p align="left">AVA is a great team of volunteer helpers who are available to assist any IRC/Austnet users that might be infected by trojans/worms and other nasties. #AVA has helped many IRC/Austnet users over the 9 years it has been operating and has made available removals, tutorials and help files to assist in the removal process.</p>

<p align="left">If you ever feel you have become infected with a virus and join #AVA for help, please be patient and polite, chances are we are busy helping someone else and whilst we might not immediately respond to your first panicked screams, someone will be with you as soon as possible.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="left">As AustNet now has mode +R, many channels have set it, so that only registered users who have identified to NickOP can access these channels. We have had many questions from users who do not know how to use services, how to register their nicks, and how to identify to them.</p>
<p align="left">To REGISTER your nickname you must follow the instructions below. Please keep in mind that these are instructions with examples.</p>
<p align="left">1: Think of a password, and write it down somewhere safe.<br />
The password must be minimum 6 characters long, with a mix of numbers and letters</p>
<p align="left">2: Use your real email address.<br />
If you lose your password for your registered nick, ASD staff can send the password direct to your email address, with instructions on how to identify to your nickname.</p>
<p align="left">3: Register your nickname.<br />
If you are using mIRC, then please ensure you follow these instructions, and look at the screenshots below.</p>
<p align="left">Query nickop to read the instructions.</p>
<p align="left">Type /query nickop help</p>
<p align="left"><a href="http://img259.imageshack.us/img259/3267/step1nc2.jpg">STEP 1 CLICK HERE</a></p>
<p align="left">Switch to the Main AustNet Status screen, nickop will send you notices, and look for the instructions. Then type out your command to register, as seen below we have used:</p>
<p align="left">/msg nickop REGISTER purpler41n immonfire@gmail.com <strong><font size="1">|| THIS IS AN EXAMPLE ONLY</font></strong></p>
<p align="left"><a href="http://img259.imageshack.us/img259/2128/step2ub7.jpg">STEP 2 CLICK HERE</a></p>
<p align="left">When you press enter, confirmation shows up in the Status screen that your nick is registered, the host, and that you have set mode +R</p>
<p align="left"><a href="http://img259.imageshack.us/img259/853/step3am6.jpg">STEP 3 CLICK HERE</a></p>
<p align="left">Now you can join any channel you wish.</p>
<p align="left">In addition, we do have many users who keep registering new nicknames, due to the current message being sent</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">EG: #sydney:You need a registered nick to join that channel, please see #ASD.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">This is leading to many users registering excessive nicknames, which is unnecessary. Users of Austnet are permitted only 4 nicknames per PERSON. ASD staff members are now deleting excessive nick registrations, and placing bans on addresses to stop further registration of nicks, and a message for the user to come into #ASD to learn how to identify.</p>
<p align="left">What users need to do, is to remember to IDENTIFY as the nicknames they have set up previously.</p>
<p align="left">You need to type the following when you next log into AustNet, otherwise you can&#8217;t join registered channels:</p>
<p align="left">Ensure you are on the AustNet Status screen, and then attempt your IDENTIFICATION.</p>
<p align="left">/msg nickop@austnet.org IDENTIFY purpler41n<strong><font size="1">||THIS IS AN EXAMPLE ONLY</font></strong></p>
<p align="left"><a href="http://img258.imageshack.us/img258/741/step4cz3.jpg">STEP 4 CLICK HERE</a></p>
<p align="left">Once you have entered in your username and password, you should get a message from nickop that would look similar below, and a line that states mode: +R has been set.</p>
<p align="left"><a href="http://img258.imageshack.us/img258/8688/step5mp9.jpg">STEP 5 CLICK HERE</a></p>
<p align="left">If you find you are still having difficulties, feel free to join #ASD and ask questions from our helpers.</p>

<p align="left">Over the last few weeks, ASD have had to deal with many people coming in and needing help with their nick registrations so they could access registered channels. We have been under enormous pressure to assist users, and we are doing our best. ASD would like to thank our users for being patient with us as we have attempted to do the best we can for everyone on the network.</p>
<p align="left">We will be putting up some help pages for assistance with NickOP and ChanOP to start with, whilst everyone gets familiar with services and +R over the next few weeks.</p>
<p align="left">On a side note, ASD managers would like to thank our ASD staff and helpers publically for their effort over the last few weeks. We are grateful for the time our staff have donated to assist our network!</p>
