            <p align="left">There are some things a person should know and be 
              aware of when spending time on the Internet in general and on AustNet 
              in particular. The tips below are just recommendations which you 
              may choose to ignore, but keep in mind that the reasons behind the 
              suggestions below still apply to you.</p>
            <p align="left"><img src="images/t_dodont_opsys.gif" width="350" height="22"><br>
              Keep the operating system updated and install the security fixes. 
              They haven&#8217;t been written for the fun of it but to correct 
              a security problem which people with unfriendly intentions may try 
              to exploit. Make it into a habit to check for security updates on 
              a regular basis. Code Red, Slammer and Blaster attacked known vulnerabilities 
              where fixes had been released long before the viruses hit.</p>
            <p align="left"><img src="images/t_dodont_virus.gif" width="350" height="22"> 
              <br>
              Install a virus scanner and keep it updated. It&#8217;s an easy 
              way to protect yourself from less desirable programs running on 
              your computer. You won&#8217;t gain more friends by installing it, 
              but at least you won&#8217;t lose any either. It&#8217;s good to 
              keep real time protection on as some virii try to disable antivirus 
              programs. It&#8217;s better to block and delete the virus before 
              it has a chance to do so. You may also want to install a spyware 
              killer to help protect your privacy.</p>
            <p align="left"><img src="images/t_dodont_firewall.gif" width="350" height="22"><br>
              Personally I&#8217;d count a firewall as less important than installing 
              the security patches and keeping a freshly updated virus scanner, 
              but even though they may be annoying at times, they protect against 
              what some of the things not covered by the security updates and 
              virus protection and when you&#8217;re connected to the Internet, 
              you will be scanned or attacked by programs testing long lists of 
              addresses.</p>
            <p align="left"><img src="images/t_dodont_password.gif" width="350" height="22"><br>
              You may have seen this before, but pick a password which isn&#8217;t 
              guessable, yet easy for you to remember. A phrase or song line (more 
              than one word) is a good choice as you will remember it. It&#8217;s 
              good to include digit and non-alphanumerical characters as it makes 
              the process of trying to guess the password harder. Also keep the 
              password private and don&#8217;t share it. If you&#8217;re asked 
              for it on AUSTnet by someone who claims to be an AUSTnet official 
              such as an IRC operator or ASD helper, don&#8217;t give it out. 
              IRC operators don&#8217;t care, and the ASD helper doesn&#8217;t 
              need it.</p>
            <p align="left"><img src="images/t_dodont_false.gif" width="350" height="22"><br>
              Try not to be paranoid, but at the same time, don&#8217; t think 
              that you&#8217;re completely safe from everything unwanted just 
              because you&#8217;ve covered the points mentioned above. A malicious 
              program doesn&#8217;t have to qualify as a virus, worm or trojan 
              in order to be malicious.</p>
            <p align="left"><img src="images/t_dodont_spam.gif" width="350" height="22"> 
              <br>
              If you dislike spam and get spammed, don&#8217;t click on it, don&#8217;t 
              go there. Spammers rarely have your best at heart and do it to achieve 
              their own goals whether it&#8217;s to make money, get more supporters 
              or to infect your computer. If no one supports these activities, 
              it would cease. If you click on it, you support it and encourage 
              the spammers to go on. Additionally, don&#8217;t spam as it&#8217;s 
              a sure way to gain a lot of enemies, including ASD members and IRC 
              operators working to rid the network from spam.</p>
            <p align="left"><img src="images/t_dodont_basics.gif" width="350" height="22"><br>
              Try to learn and understand the basic IRC commands. This makes you 
              less dependent on others to help you, who may not be around at times 
              when you actually do need help. The help files are a good source 
              of knowledge and they are usually meant to be written in a way which 
              can be understood. You shouldn&#8217;t need an Enigma code breaker 
              to decipher it. If you get stuck, you can ask for help in #Help 
              or #ASD if its services related.</p>
            <p align="left"><img src="images/t_dodont_rules.gif" width="350" height="22"> 
              <br>
              The rules of the network are there to provide you with a better 
              overall service. Knowing the rules of the playground can save you 
              from the consequences of breaking them. Furthermore, the volunteers 
              who try to make the network run smoothly already have enough to 
              do without you adding to it.</p>
            <p align="left"><img src="images/t_dodont_exploration.gif" width="350" height="22"><br>
              Curiosity is good, but try not to get too excited and adventurous. 
              If you want to find out what some script or command does, check 
              the help files, ask someone who may know or find out or simply look 
              at the code to see if it seems to do something useful. You don&#8217;t 
              want to turn your IRC client into a spam bot. If you get a message 
              when you join a channel regarding how to stop spamming, don&#8217;t 
              try it out as it&#8217;s not likely to do what the message claims. 
              If there were a short and simple way to stop spam with simple commands, 
              it would already be included in the IRC servers. </p>
            <p align="left"><img src="images/t_dodont_truth.gif" width="350" height="22"><br>
              You&#8217;re most likely aware that some people lie from time to 
              time to different degrees. Don&#8217;t believe in everything you 
              hear on the Internet just because you hear it. Someone may be telling 
              you the truth, but at times it may be a lie. There is no need to 
              go completely paranoid, but use common sense and think about if 
              it makes sense or not. This doesn&#8217;t only apply on the Internet, 
              but IRC is a text medium and the signs you may see in real life 
              when talking to someone don&#8217;t exist. Keep a reasonable level 
              of caution and you may save yourself from a lot of pain.</p>
            <p align="left"><img src="images/t_dodont_actions.gif" width="350" height="22"><br>
              If you misbehave in a channel, you&#8217;re likely to get banned 
              so don&#8217;t be surprised if it happens. If you&#8217;re an op 
              banning someone from a channel, do it when there is a reason and 
              not just for fun. When you ban, try to make the ban message a polite 
              one. No one likes to be insulted or ridiculed. The reaction of senseless 
              bans may be that your channel gets flooded as payback. On the other 
              hand, if you&#8217;re the one doing the flooding, you&#8217;re not 
              likely to get the ban lifted as the channel operators are unlikely 
              to appreciate the flood and you will end up spending a lot of time 
              and energy to maintain an aggravation which won&#8217;t get you 
              anywhere. Just like in real life, the people you encounter on Internet 
              have feelings and emotions. If you treat them badly, they won&#8217;t 
              like you and they will treat you accordingly and so will their friends. 
            </p>
            <p align="left"><img src="images/t_dodont_common.gif" width="350" height="22"><br>
              Just as in real life, always use common sense. If you see something, 
              think about what it may mean. Usually there is some kind of logic 
              behind things. If you need help from someone, try to think about 
              what he or she may need to know in order to help you. If you send 
              an e- mail, you will save time by sending the needed information 
              at once as the replier doesn&#8217;t need to mail back and ask for 
              it. </p>
