Our dedicated ops will gladly answer any questions you might have about AustNet services, IRC in general, or, specifically, the mIRC client as long as it doesn't pertain to war scripts, hacking, or anything else deemed inappropriate by the channel's leaders.  Should you find you can't reach us for some reason, visit our <a href="http://www.bright.net/~kparks/">web page</a> and submit a question through our special <b>Ask</b> form.  You can also fill out an application to become an operator on our lovely channel.
