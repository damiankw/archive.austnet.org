Before I begin, it is important to note that AustNet is the product of hard
work from not only one person, but hundreds of people who have strived to
make this network certainly one of the best, and to all those people,
you have my most sincere thanks.<br><br>

However, behind the scenes, at the early hours of the morning, there have
been certain people who have helped develop, administer and mould the
growth of the network into the success it is today.  To these people in
particular (all of whom I will mention later), you have my deepest gratitude
and I hope you have enjoyed our success as much as I have.<br><br>

Firstly, I would like to personally thank IRC's best coder, the creator
of the AustNet services, the IRC Gateway, and the one friend who has been by my side through
the highs and lows of creating AustNet, <b><a href="mailto:rogery@austnet.org">Roger Yerramsetti</b></a> (RogerY).  Roger has
tought me many lessons in life, both in irc development and network
management, and has put so much energy into AustNet that words cannot express
my thanks.  Without him, we would simply not be where we are today, and without
Roger, the network would not have the best services in town.  We here at AustNet
are forever in debt to him for his continued support and administration of
the network, and I strongly recommend that if you find yourself with a spare
second, that you <a href="mailto:rogery@austnet.org">mail Roger</a>
expressing our thanks.<br><br>

Secondly, throughout the growth of AustNet, there has been one woman who has
been there all along, keeping AustNet's friendly face smiling, <b><a href="mailto:lydian@austnet.org">Amanda Walsh</b></a> (Lydian).
Amanda has kept the torch shining initially when AustNet faced teething problems,
her personal support and encouragement towards the network and myself enabled
AustNet to ultimately succeed.  Amanda is one of those rare gems that are very hard
to find, and its reassuring to know that both her technical network management
skills and her charismatic personality will fuel AustNet's fire for many years
to come.  Amanda, I thank you from the bottom of my heart.<br><br>

I'd like to now thank the two Andrews, <b><a href="mailto:andrew@aussie.net">Andrew Khoo</b></a> (bigbear)
and <b><a href="mailto:adf@fl.net.au">Andrew Foster</a></b> (Andrew) for their continued
application of internet technology, irc knowledge, bandwidth and machine donations and their committment
to making AustNet, to use the cliche, "simply the best".  Many people take for
granted the resources these two men have donated to the network, ranging from
the mailing lists to the AustNet domain.  Individually, I would like to thank
Andrew Khoo for his belief in me and the AustNet dream, the support and
the hours spent solving technical problems.  Andrew Khoo has been on of the
major supporters of both Australian and International IRC, and I am proud
to have him on board with us at AustNet.   Similarly, AustNet owes a great
deal to Andrew Foster for his dedication to our services, mailing lists and
many other resources he houses for us.  Andrew Foster has set the future standard
in relation to our technical superiority, providing us with advanced network
security, continued administrative support and the bandwidth our services
chew through daily.  Both Roger Yerramsetti and myself owe a great deal to
both Andrews, and we thank you both for your support.<br><br>

I would like to also thank <a href="mailto:tazq@austnet.org"><b>Max Byrd</b></a> (TazQ)
for his dedication to the making the AustNet Servers the most innovative and
superior.  Max's continued support and development of the IRCD has enabled
us to have a competitive edge over all other IRC networks.  There have also
been five founding members who have developed AustNet's client support and
network management standards, namely <a href="mailto:phil@austnet.org"><b>
Phil Pudney</a></b> (WebMaster), <a href="mailto:cinder@austnet.org"><b>
Rob Wise</a></b> (Cinder), <a href="mailto:burger@austnet.org"><b>Chris Davis
</a></b> (Burger), <a href="mailto:maddog@austnet.org"><b>Ben Carceller</a></b> (maddog) and
<a href="mailto:adrian@austnet.org"><b>Adrian Chadd</b></a> (Adrian).  Our thanks are
extended to you all for keeping the network on track throughout the development
period and your committment in helping us make AustNet a great network.<br><br>

I would personally like to thank the following friends for their continued support
of AustNet and your time devoted to maintaining the network.  Everyone owes
you all a great deal of thanks for making AustNet the industrial strength
chat network that it is.<br><br>

Thanks extend to everyone who has contributed in every small way, unfortunately
we have so many people to thank that we cannot list them all here for fear
of leaving out some.  I thank everyone who has made AustNet the best IRC
network sincerely, you all know who you are.<br><br>

Sincerely,<br>
