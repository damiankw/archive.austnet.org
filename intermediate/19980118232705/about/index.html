<br><b>About AustNet</b><hr>

Thousands of people around the world connect through the
Internet to the Relay Chat, a popular communication method of the 21st 
century. Originating in 1988, the concept of the Relay Chat has grown to 
the forfront of Internet participation and continues to expand along side 
the information technology revolution.
<P>Looking for an alternative to the lag, splits and politics of DALnet,
the takeovers of EFnet, and the time it takes to register a channel on
Undernet? Then its time for you to give AustNet a try!</P>
<P>AustNet is based upon the principle of an efficient, secure
and well developed network that allows users to own their channels and 
actively participate in the growth of an International network.   
Founded in <b>Australia</b>, AustNet has rapidly expanded through <b>Canada</b>,
<b>Singapore</b>, <b>New Zeland</b> and the <b>United States</b>, providing international coverage,
with high quality servers. AustNet holds minimal lag and netsplits along
with exceptional public services.</p>
<p>Along side AustNet's efficient servers, the network provides 
users with the abilities to register their channels and nicknames. 
Featuring superior technical innovations, AustNet excels in client 
services and online help.<br>

<br><b>Why AustNet?</b><hr>
AustNet is an international network that aims to be rid of server splits, political fatigue that ruins other IRC networks and finally a network that
allows users to enjoy IRC.
<P>
In doing so, we offer technical innovations individual to our network. These
include:</P>

<UL><li><u>ChanOP</u> (Channel Registration)<br>
The Channel Operator Service allows users to register
their channels and maintain a secure method of issuing operator status.
More than a mere "bot", ChanOP is a server, effectively allowing it to
maintain from within or outside the channel.  This service allows the
channel owner(s) the ability to keep their channel open <b>24 hours</b>.
</li></UL>

<UL><li><u>NickOP</u> (Nickname Registration)<br>
The Nickname registra controls who has authorisation to use certain
nicknames.  Upon connecting to <b>any</b> AustNet server, your nickname
is validified with NickOP and if it is not yours, you are given the
option to authenticate yourself or be disconnected.  NickOP has speedy
registration facilities, for further information, <a href="/services/index.html">click here</a>.
</li></UL>

<UL><li><u>Minimal netsplits and lag</u><br>
AustNet servers are positioned strategically and are not normally subject
to the lag and splits that plague other networks.  The network does not have
an "open" server link policy, and new servers are to be voted in based on
their performance.  For information regarding linking a server,

</li></UL>

<ul><li><u>Friendly and ethical network operators</u><br>
AustNet networks operators, or IRC Operators, are trained to the
highest standards to meet the user's demands.  Unlike other IRC
networks, IRC Operators at AustNet are required to run by a strict
code of ethics.
</li></UL>

<ul><li><u>Server Innovations</u><br>
AustNet servers are based and located in the most suitable positions
world wide. Along side the well managed topology, servers run the most
innovative server software around the IRC.  Merging latest patches and
combining the powerful code of other genres of ircd, AustNet ircd is
aclaimed to be one of the most "technically superior" available.
This gives you, the user, a better connection to the AustNet than
any other network.
