<FONT SIZE="3"><B><A NAME="1">What is the AustNet Services Department?</A></B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

The AustNet Services Department is a group who help manage the
services (ChanOP, NickOP and so on) and assist users with
services-related problems. They also monitor and correct abuse of
these services, in accordance with the AustNet services guidelines. To
do these things, they use a service named ASD. 


<P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B><A NAME="2">What is ASD?</A></B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

ASD is a service provided by AustNet for services operators and
administrators. Server operators who require special access to
AustNet's Open Public Access System (OPAS) may use ASD to assist IRC
users whom require technical support. ASD is also used to restrict
abusive users' access to the network and correct crisis situations
concerning channel operator-less channels. 

<P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B><A NAME="3">What can the Services department do for me?</A></B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

The Services people are available to help you use a service and show
you commands, recover your password if you have lost it and can prove
that it is yours, or assist you if you think another user has violated
the services guidelines. ASD is not here to undo bans for you, kick
people you don't like, ban people from AustNet, or to provide
non-services related help. Some services people also look after IRC
weddings. 

<P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B><A NAME="4">What are the Services policies?</A></B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

Policies:
<UL>
  <LI>No mass messaging/advertising/inviting 
  <LI>No services flooding (including NickOP/LoveOP floods) 
  <LI>Any or all of the above can and will end in the suspension of
      your channel, whether done by the owner or a member of that
      channel. If your channel is suspended, please contact #ASD to
      find the ASD Operator that suspended it, so that it may be
      discussed. Generally the suspension will remain until it
      expires.
</UL>

<P>

Restrictions: 
<UL>
  <LI>Maximum of 4 nicks per user allowed to be registered 
  <LI>Maximum of 1 channel per nick allowed to be registered 
  <LI>Any violations may and will result in the removal of some and/or
      all nicks/channels. 
</UL>
<P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B><A NAME="5">How do I find a Services person when I need one?</A></B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

The most obvious place is their channel, #ASD. If you have a services
query just type <FONT SIZE="3"><TT>/join #ASD</TT></FONT> and ask in
the channel. If nobody seems to be awake type <FONT SIZE="3"><TT>/msg
ASD listadmin</TT></FONT> for a list of services people which shows
who is online and who is not away. In the unlikely event of absolutely
nobody being on, you are welcome to mail
<A HREF="mailto:services@austnet.org">services@austnet.org</A>.

<P>

All ASD people have a line in their WHOIS response showing that they
represent the ASD. If somebody appears to be impersonating an ASD
person let an IRC operator or ASD administrator know. 

<P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B><A NAME="6">What is Spam?</A></B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

Spam is unsolicited advertising of a channel. It usually falls to ASD
to prevent spamming, and the definition of spam that we work from is a
<B>non-op advertising in a channel that doesn't want advertisements, 
OR a mass message/invitation to people who would not wish to join the
channel.</B> 

<P>

What does this mean? 
<UL>
  <LI>A #chatzone op sending a user from #chatzone into #sex would not
      be spamming.
  <LI>A #chatzone non-op asking people in #chatzone to come to
      #melbteens would be spamming, because #chatzone do not allow
      that.
  <LI>A person on #chan telling people to join #wicked is allowed
      because the #chan ops allow advertising (very rare indeed).
  <LI>Any person on any channel using the
      <FONT SIZE="3"><TT>/invite</TT></FONT> or
      <FONT SIZE="3"><TT>/msg</TT></FONT> commands to invite
      non-friends is spamming.
</UL>

<P>


The possible results of spamming are: 
<UL>
  <LI>Being banned from the channel you spammed in by an operator (not
      by ASD).
  <LI>Having your access removed and being banned from the channel you
      spammed if you are lower than 190, preferably by the channel
      owner but if not by ASD (channel owners are expected to
      co-operate with ASD personell at all times).
  <LI>Having your channel suspended if you are the manager or have
      access 190 or greater.
  <LI>Being removed from the network by an IRC operator.
</UL>

<P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B><A NAME="7">How do the `fun commands work?</A></B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

There are two sorts of `fun commands, ordinary ones which have the bot
bring you coffee or other such things, and the "r-rated" ones, which
aren't really suitable for children. Any person with sufficient
channel access to use the set command can turn on the normal type (set
nochanmsg off and funmsg on), but it takes an ASD person to turn on
the other type. If you're a channel manager, over 18 and the channel
isn't for teens or children you can join #ASD and ask for "r-rated
fun" to be turned on. Note that ASD does not control who can join a
channel, and therefore takes no responsibility for incorrect use of
"r-rated fun".

<P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B><A NAME="8">What rules are there for ASD people?</A></B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

Because of the access they have, services people are governed by
guidelines covering almost every situation they may have to deal with.
If you are conerned about the actions of anyone using ASD, please
send e-mail to
<A HREF="mailto:abuse@austnet.org">abuse@austnet.org</A> with
information and logs to support your complaint. Information sent to
this address is dealt with on a one-to-one basis, and action is
decided by a specialist group of trustworthy and independant people.
