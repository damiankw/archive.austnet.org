              Many people around the world connect to Internet Relay Chat (or 
              IRC), which is an increasingly popular means of communication. First 
              created in 1988, IRC has been developed further and rapidly grown 
              since then to become what it is today -- a medium in which thousands 
              of participants can all choose where to chat, and what to chat about. 
              Chatting to friends, family or just meeting new people across the 
              world is made easy with IRC.</SPAN></font>
              <p>Come and join Austnet - and leave behind the extensive lag, netsplits 
                and channel takeovers of other networks. AustNet's top-class services 
                allow you to register your own nickname and channel with no lengthy 
                waits.</p>
              <p>Austnet is based upon the principle of an efficient, secure and 
                well-developed network that allows users to own their channels 
                and actively participate in the growth of an International network. 
                Founded in Australia, AustNet has rapidly expanded through Singapore, 
                Europe and the United States, providing international coverage 
                with high quality servers. Austnet experiences minimal lag and 
                netsplits and provides exceptional public services.</p>

              <P> <FONT SIZE="3"><B>Why AustNet?</B></FONT> 
              <HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">
              AustNet is an international network that aims to be rid of server 
              splits, political fatigue and nuking that ruins other IRC networks 
              - finally a network that allows users to enjoy IRC. 
              <P> In doing so, we offer technical innovations individual to our 
                network. These include:</P>
              <UL>
                <LI><B>ChanOP</B> (Channel Registration)<BR>
                  The channel operator service allows users to register their 
                  channels and maintain a secure method of issuing operator status. 
                  More than a mere "bot", ChanOP is a server, allowing it to operate 
                  from inside or outside the channel. This service allows the 
                  channel owner(s) the ability to keep their channel open <B>24 
                  hours</B>. 
                  <P> 
                <LI><B>NickOP</B> (Nickname Registration)<BR>
                  The nickname registra controls who has authorisation to use 
                  certain nicknames. Upon connecting to <B>any</B> AustNet server, 
                  your nickname is verified with NickOP and if it is not yours, 
                  you are given the option to authenticate yourself or use another 
                  nickname. AustNet was the first known IRC network to implement 
                  a function for services to <B>force a nick change</B>, unlike 
                  other networks, which disconnect you if you fail to authenticate. 
                  NickOP has speedy registration facilities. 
                  <P> 
                <LI><B>Minimal netsplits and lag</B><BR>
                  AustNet servers are positioned strategically and are not normally 
                  subject to the lag and splits that plague other networks. The 
                  network does not have an "open" server link policy, and new 
                  servers are voted in based on their performance. 
                  <P> 
                <LI><B>Friendly and ethical network operators</B><BR>
                  AustNet network operators, or IRC Operators, are trained to 
                  the highest standards to meet the user's demands. Unlike other 
                  IRC networks, IRC Operators at AustNet are required to act according 
                  to a strict code of ethics. 
                  <P> 
                <LI><B>Server innovations</B><BR>
                  AustNet servers are based and located in the most suitable positions 
                  world wide. Alongside the well managed topology, servers run 
                  the most innovative server software of any network. Merging 
                  latest patches, combining the powerful code of other genres 
                  of IRCd, and developing our own code; AustNet's IRC daemon is 
                  acclaimed to be one of the most "technically superior" available. 
                  This gives you, the user, a better connection to the AustNet 
                  than any other network. Features include long nicknames (15 
                  characters), full topic and mode synchronisation, the ability 
                  to display or hide channels without users, faster data bursting, 
                  anti-spam measures, in-channel services commands, long topics, 
                  and the world-first <B>Virtual World</B> to finally disperse 
                  nuking on IRC.
