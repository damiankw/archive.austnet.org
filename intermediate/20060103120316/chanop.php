      <p><strong>ChanOP</strong></p>
      <p><strong>What is ChanOP?</strong><br />ChanOP (also known as the Channel Operator) is quite simply, an IRC robot. It is not a real person, it is an automated service that ensures channel integrity and protection from malicious takeover attempts. The ChanOP service allows users to register their channels and maintain a secure method of issuing operator status amongst the channel. More than a mere &quot;bot&quot;, ChanOP is also a server, effectively allowing it to maintain every aspect of your channel according to your wishes.<br />ChanOP is run by ASD (AustNet Services Department), a group of volunteers who devote their time to assisting users with services. If you require online support from ASD, simple type /join #asd (while connected to an AustNet server). </p>
      <p><strong>How does it protect channels?</strong><br />ChanOP monitors who receives operator priviliges on all registered channels. It also has the ability to unban, kick and deop users on request, and has inbuilt automated facilities that ensure correct channel usage.</p>
      <p><strong>How does it differ from other bots?</strong><br />ChanOP differs from other bots simply because it is not a bot. ChanOP is a server. AustNet servers are built with special functions that dissallow users kicking and banning ChanOP from channels. It also has special privileges that allow it to gain operator status on any channel. It can not be flooded nor nick-collided off IRC.<br />ChanOP's completely automated channel registration eliminates the lengthy application process found on other networks. ChanOP is easy to use, very responsive, and above all provides seamless channel security that other IRC network's bots cannot always provide.</p>
      <p><strong>How do I get myself a ChanOP?</strong><br />ChanOP is a service provided by AustNet, it is not a piece of software available for distribution. ChanOP is part of an IRC process generated by a 50Mb+ program for UNIX called &quot;OPAS&quot;, written by Roger Yerramsetti. ChanOP is one of the many services that this program provides, so essentially you do not &quot;get&quot; a ChanOP. Rather, ChanOP has the ability to sit on or off thousands of registered channels. If you would like ChanOP to monitor your channel, you must first register it.<br />Firstly, check to see if the channel you are interested in is already registered:<br />/msg ChanOP info #[channel]<br />This will display information about the channel in question if it is registered, if it is not, you will be told so.<br />Registration is done quickly, to do so, simply:<br />/msg ChanOP register #[channel]<br />then follow the instructions given by ChanOP.</p>
      <p><strong>What channels are eligible for ChanOP?</strong><br />ChanOP will not allow illegal content channels to be registered. At the time of writing, ChanOP will not allow any warez, mp3 trading or child pornography channels to be registered. If this genre of channel was permitted to be registered, we would be legally bound by endorsing such activities. Consequently, we must at all times disclaim any legal liability against such channels and therefore deny ChanOP services to these channels.</p>
      <p><strong>Can I register more than one channel?</strong><br />Due to AustNet's &quot;first in first served&quot; channel registration policy, we originally did not permit any users to register more than one channel. In recent times this requirement has been relaxed and people may now register more than one channel (with alternate nicknames). If this policy is abused, with more than 4 nicknames and 4 channels registered, all of the nicknames and channels may be terminated, and in some cases that user may be banned from registering any further channels. You have been warned.</p>
      <p><strong>How can I complain about ChanOP being on a channel?</strong><br />ASD can only get involved in these kind of disputes if the channel has been registered contrary to the network guidelines, or if there is an ongoing dispute. Please email asdadmin@austnet.org with the complaint, any relevant logs and a list of the nicknames and email addresses of those who support your complaint.</p>
      <p><strong>I've registered my channel, now what?</strong><br />If you are the owner of a channel, it is your responsibility to promote channel growth, configure your channel for operation and to add users to your channel access database.</p>
      <p><strong>What is ChanOP access?</strong><br />Each registered channel has a userlist. This list contains nicknames of people who have been given certain privileges on the channel. An access level is indicative of what privileges each user has. Access levels range from 0 to 200, where 0 is no access, and 200 is the Channel Manager/Founder access. In order to execute certain commands through ChanOP, you must have the required access level.</p>
      <p><strong>How do I receive access to a channel?</strong><br />Access to a certain channel is issued by the Channel Manager and his or her delegated trusted channel operators (that is, anyone above 150 access). If you wish to receive access to a channel, you should speak with the channel manager directly, or with an existing channel operator. Should you be given access, you will probably be required to confirm your access (you will have &quot;Pending&quot; next to your nick in the channel access list). To do this, type<br />/msg chanop confirm #channelname yournickname.</p>
      <p><strong>How do I know if I have access?</strong><br />Generally speaking, if you have access, you should know. However, to check your access level to a specific channel, simply use the following command:<br />/msg ChanOP access #[channel]<br />This command will return your access level on the specified channel, or an error message.</p>
      <p><strong>I have access, what can I do with it?</strong><br />You can execute commands through ChanOP based on what access level you have. While you are online, simply type the following command to view your available commands on a specific channel:<br />/msg ChanOP commands #[channel]<br />This will return your available commands<br />/msg ChanOP help [command]<br />Will show you online help for a specific command</p>
      <p><strong>How do I use basic commands through ChanOP?</strong><br />The following basic commands allow you to execute very simple tasks within a channel, including kicking, banning, issuing and removing operator status and changing the topic.<br />Kick a user from a channel:<br />/msg ChanOP kick #[channel] [nickname] [reason]<br />Ban a user from a channel:<br />/msg ChanOP ban #[channel] [nickname]|[userhost] [reason]<br />Removing a ban on user from a channel:<br />/msg ChanOP unban #[channel] [nickname]|[userhost]<br />Listing active bans on a user:<br />/msg ChanOP listban #[channel] [nickname]|[userhost]<br />Issuing operator status to a user on a channel:<br />/msg ChanOP op #[channel] [nickname]<br />Removing operator status from a user on a channel:<br />/msg ChanOP deop #[channel] [nickname]<br />Removing everyone's operator status from channel:<br />/msg ChanOP mdeop #[channel]<br />Inviting a user to a channel:<br />/msg ChanOP invite #[channel] [nickname]<br />Changing the current channel topic:<br />/msg ChanOP topic #[channel] [topic]</p>
      <p><strong>Can I have 2 or more people with level 200 access in my channel?</strong><br />No, there can only be 1 owner per channel. By giving a user an access level of 190 or above, they have access to exactly the same commands as the channel owner, except the &quot;drop&quot; command. However, even if you were allowed more than 1 person at a level of 200, they would not be able to access this command anyhow (there is a difference between the channel &quot;owner&quot; and someone with level 200 access). Some channels do have more than 1 person at level 200. This is because they were added before we made every command available to users with an access level of 190 or more.</p>
