<p><b>What is the AustNet Promotions Department?</b><br>
AustNet Promotions Department exists to promote AustNet by traditional media - radio, newspapers, magazines, television and other innovative ways, such as celebrity interviews live online. We do not use intrusive methods, such as spamming, but rather try to educate the public about the possibilies of the net, and especially IRC and AustNet.<br>

<p><b>What can we do for you, and the possiblities of IRC</b><br>
IRC is not new, but with the burgeoning popularity of the Internet it is becoming ever more popular as a cheap, easy and fast way to make new friends and keep in touch with friends and family. The possibilities for your organisation, be it media, business or community organisation are vast. With more and more people on the net, they want an easy way to communicate, and IRC is it. You can organise online events, moderated by our administration - such as celebrity, author or public figure interviews, online reportage, or product promotions that will benefit both you by widening your audience around the world, and us by popularising AustNet.<br>

<!--<p><b>Possibly previous promotional things we've done</b><br>

<p><b>How can go I about organising my online event?</b><br>
The first thing to do is get in touch with us by email. From there we can organise all the details - type of event, time and availability of staff, resources and personalities. Mail <A HREF="mailto:promotions@austnet.org">AustNet Promotions Department </A>and ask us about the possibilities.<br>
