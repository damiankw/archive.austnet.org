<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Preface</B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

The AustNet IRC Network is supposed to be a friendly network of
communication. Less lag, no collides, kills etc. ASD Operators are
friendly and helpful. If you need services help, you can always get it
from #ASD, and ASD Operators are expected to behave in accordance with
the status quo of IRC. 

<P>

This means that you are to oversee the operations of services and #ASD
as an operator of the channel. This also means that you general duties
of being an ASD Operator are to act in a respectful and disciplined
way. If a user annoys you, do not show that you are annoyed. Everyone
is entitled to their opinion. You are expected to use /ignore like
everyone else. 

<P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Definitions</B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

The following terms and abbreviations will be used throughout this
document:

<P>

<UL>
  <LI>"ASD" - <I>AustNet Services Department.</I>
  <LI>"ASD Operator" - <I>A person with official ASD access.</I>
  <LI>"ASD Administrator" - <I>A person with ASD access level of "300".</I>
  <LI>"HOD" - <I>Head of Department.</I>
  <LI>"network operator" - <I>A person with an official O-line on AustNet
  (i.e. IRC operator).</I>
  <LI>"CEO" - <I>the AustNet Chief Executive Officer.</I>
  <LI>"the department" - <I>the AustNet Services Department.</I>
  <LI>"user" - <I>A person with no affiliation with AustNet.</I>
  <LI>"services" - <I>The AustNet Open Public Access Services (OPAS).</I>
</UL>

<P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B>General Behavior</B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

In regard to the operations of the ASD, ASD Operators are not to swear,
be abusive (whether in response to abuse or not) and act in a civilised
manner. The emphasis is on self-control and discipline. A lot of it is
common sense. Please do not use abusive or possibly abusive language or
be offensive in nature. You will find your self on a short route OUT of
the department if you behave like this. 

<P>

Please adhere to common sense and logical reasoning and never let hot
headedness become your enemy. 

<P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B>#ASD</B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

#ASD is the channel of the AustNet Services Department. It is there for
people to obtain swift, efficient and correct information when they
require help with services. Therefore you will provide them with
exactly that. As an ASD Operator, you are expected to frequent #ASD as
often as possible, or else your access will be suspended or removed 
indefinately.

<P>

However, behavior such as the following will not be tolerated: 

<P>

<TT>
* h4x0r watches as the sights level on WarHead.<BR>
* h4x0r watches as the bomb hits WarHead and pounds him 20ft into the
  ground.</TT>

<P>

Not only is it flooding, it is annoying to other users as the above is
totally unrelated to services, is a pain, and confuses newbies. On top
of that, pounding someone 20ft into the ground is not very polite and
comforting. 

<P>

There is also to be absolutely no idle chat (i.e. non-services
discussion) when somebody requires assistance, nor is there to be
abusive behavior or giving out of incorrect information. All idle chat
should be taken to #ASD-Conference.

<P>

Do not ban people from #ASD in jest or just for fun. It's not a game,
it's channel. It's all about a communication network. 

<P>

If you do ban someone, the ASD Administration will expect to find a
good reason for it (preferably in a log file) or someone to vouch that
it was necessary should we get any complaints. 

<P>

The general reasons that will be accepted:
<UL>
  <LI>Flooding 
  <LI>Spam 
  <LI>Constant abusive nature (everyong is entitled to their opinion
    though) 
  <LI>Continous harrassment of other users and ASD operators
  <LI>Giving incorrect or fale information and syntaxes 
  <LI>Discussion unrelated to services
</UL>

<P>

Be reminded that banning a user has the effect of a mute on them so
they are unable to speak or unable to change their nick. If they leave
the channel they won't be able to get back in (obviously) so if someone
is being abusive, just place a ban on them for a while (do not kick
them) but the ban will prevent them from saying anything, and this may
let them calm down or they will become more frustrated and leave. 

<P>

If they personally abuse you, inform them if they persist they will be
ignored. Then ignore them if they persist.

<P>

Host bans are bans such as *!*@student.uq.edu.au prevent all users from
student services at the University of Queensland from accessing the
channel or speaking if they are already present on this. This is to be
used only if no other way to prevent unacceptable behaviour is
possible.

<P>

In the case where a user is using an dynamic SLIP/PPP address such as
fred@cs5p11.gil.com.au, you may have to ban the host,
*!*@cs5p11.gil.com.au, to prevent them changing their username which is
always a problem with PPP/SLIP accounts. 

<P>

Domain bans ban the entire domain of a network. An example would be
*!*@*.ozemail.com.au. This would prevent anyone using OzEmail to enter
#ASD or speak if they are on it. When you're talking domain bans such
as *!*@*.ozemail.com.au, you're talking about banning a lot of people,
remember that when you think about domain banning someone. Domain bans
are highly discouraged, and require a very good reason.

<P>

Generally you shouldn't have to do this unless for some reason a user
has multiple accounts over that network or is perhaps even an
administrator of the network and able to twist his host and username to
his own means. 

<P>

Opping users who are not official ASD Operators and who are not on the
op list is strictly prohibited and will result in suspension of both 
#ASD and services access. Whenever changes occur, you will be notified
so there is no excuse whatsoever for breaching this rule. 


<P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Weddings</B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

To have a wedding the netcouple must first book it. When they book it,
a note is sent to #chapel. Once they have booked, someone from the
#chapel database contacts them to arrange a suitable time. 

<P>

Make sure the to be married couple are using the nicks that are listed
on the engaged list database (<B>/msg loveop netcouple list engaged *</B>) or
LoveOP won't recognise them. 

<P>

<UL>
  <LI>Check they are on engaged database.
  <LI>Send a note to #chapel before you do the wedding so no one doubles
  up.
  <LI>Arrange a suitable time with the nicks that is mutually suitable.
  <LI>Send the couple to #help to learn how to copy and paste.
  <LI>At the moment we only have the script worded for a male/female couple
  but we will work on getting another script made for other couples if
  needed. Weddings only work for #chapel (hardcoded into services). 
  <LI>Set the nicks so the script can read them.
  <LI>Send ChanOP out of the channel.
  <LI>Op only yourself and voice the couple.
  <LI>Moderate the channel.
  <LI>Once it calms down set +i before you start.
  <LI>Once the wedding is over -mi.
  <LI>Deop yourself let the couple stand alone with LoveOP only.
  <LI>After everyone leaves bring ChanOP back on channel.
  <LI>Couples breaking up can use the netcouple del command themselves.
</UL>

<P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Nick Deletes</B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

This is generally used when you see the global notices possible nick
abuse. However if it is a common mask (eg user@*.sg) it will show all
people with that mask as being connected. Please check by messaging the
nick to see if they are on a network/lan, if they are a school, or have
a reason for needing more than 4 nicknames. 

<P>

<UL>
  <LI>First try to msg them to see why they have so many.<BR>
    e.g. /msg <nick> Excuse me, but why do you need more than 4 nicks?

  <P>

  <LI>Second you check /msg ChanOP list nick to see if they own a channel.
  If you delete the nick it will suspend the channel. 

  <P>

  <LI>Lastly you check their linked nicks to see how many other nicks are
  linked to theirs. <BR>
    e.g. /msg ASD NickOP <nick> link list

  <P>

  <LI>Delete the nick.<BR>
    e.g. /msg ASD delnick <nick>
</UL>

<P>

If there are a large number of nicks registered, as is usually the case
with nick "stealers" or holders, then find an ASD Administrator to
mass-delete all the nicks, instead of sending a flood of delete
commands. If there are no ASD administrators active, set an OPAS ignore
and delete the nicks.

<P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Password Retrieval</B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

All users have email addresses stored with NickOP. There is NO reason
to tell any user his password; you should instead mail it to the
address given (services will do this for you with the -email optioin).
If that address is not valid, nothing can be done. 

<P>

The only exception is that if there are minor typing errors in the set
e-mail address, e.g. brackets enclosing or, ".ua" instead of ".au". In
this case, use NickOP to correct the e-mail address, and then send the
password. Obvious changes to the username or host (e.g. "admin" to
"administrator") do not count.

<P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Channel owner's nickname has expired</B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

<UL>
  <LI>Check with the channel if the owner will be back.
  <LI>Do not unsuspend the channel while there is no nick registered, or
      else it will automatically suspend again.
  <LI>Get the person to re-register the nickname.
  <LI>In some cases, the person will not be back. If this is the case, give
      the channel to the next highest on access list. Always check this
      user with the -lm and -ls options, to see who the owner would have
      chosen, and who is on-line more often. If you do not have enough
      access to do this, refer the nick to an ASD Administrator.
</UL>

<P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Suspension for services abuse </B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

This can include note, seek and funmsg flooding, or using topic to
advertise other networks, etc. 

<P>

<UL>
  <LI>First check the channel is doing wrong. 
  <LI>Check that the offenders have ops or on the database, using the
      -check option.
  <LI>Warn them. Everyone is entitled to one chance. Quote /motd services.*
      Give the channel the chance to ban the nick and or remove access.
  <LI>If the channel continues suspend it, quoting a reason and where
      possible some proof. 
  <LI>Never remove a suspension you didn't place unless the person who
      placed it asked you to. 
  <LI>If you discover proof that a channel is being "framed" by somebody
      else, suspend the framer's channel. 
  <LI>Remember, ChanOP keeps records of all previous suspensions, so <B>be
      careful of framed channels</B>, as a future suspension will be affected.
      Check EVERYTHING!.
</UL>

<P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Suspension for advertising or mass inviting </B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

This is when a channel goes into other channels disrupts their sessions
and tells everyone to come to their channel. This can be done by
joining other channels and doing it on a channel, or private messages,
or mass spamming without joining. 

<P>

<UL>
  <LI>Join the channel, paste the spam, and allow the channel a chance to
      deal with it. Be polite. You are not a "cop" or a "bouncer".
  <LI>Check they have access or ops. Use -check option and examine linked
      nicks. 
  <LI>If they persist then suspend the channel, giving the spam pasted as
      reason for suspending. 
  <LI>Never remove a suspension you didn't place unless the person who
      placed it asked you to. 
  <LI>Do not suspend a channel and give it back 5 mins later. That is not
      long enough to be educational. 
  <LI>If you do not have access to execute a command, use the /helpme
      command to get a senior ASD. Make sure you have done all the
      appropriate checks before using /helpme.
</UL>

<P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Using ASD access to control ChanOP </B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

Do not do this unless there are no alternatives. ASD does not own the
channel, so we do not have the right to use ChanOP unless there is
abuse going on and there is no other means to rectify a situation that
could affect other people in a bad way. 

<P>

Flooding, virus spreading, and other non-services abuse is not to be
dealt with by ASD Operators in any circumstances. You are to let the
channel operators deal with it, or obtain the assistance of a network
operator. Remember, ASD is for services assistance only.

<P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Denying registration to a nick or channel </B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

This is used only if a user is abusing services. Do not use this
facility in fun. 

<P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Instructing the Services to ignore a user</B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

Do not use this command unless necessary: its effects are permanent. 
Once on services ignore, a person cannot remove themselves -- therefore
it is up to you to maintain ignores you set. 

<P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Protecting a channel or nick from automatic expiration</B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

Only do this for Austnet related channels or nicks (helpers/opers,
promotion channels etc). Exceptions are sometimes made by ASD
Administrators on a temporary basis.

<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Modifying the registration status of a channel</B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

Use this in situations such as promotions where an email has been sent
to austnet.org. This is also used to change a registered owner or
remove a channel. 

<P>

<UL>
  <LI>Check if nick/channel are being used .
  <LI>Check to see if the user already owns a channel .
  <LI>Do not delete a channel if there is no valid reason. Modify it to

If someone is deleted from ASD please send note to #ASD so we know. If
someone is added to ASD please send note to #ASD, quoting the level. 

<P>

All ASD Operators are required to be subscribed to the services mailing
list <A HREF="mailto:services@austnet.org">services@austnet.org</A>. Information on how-to-subscribe can be
obtained from <A HREF="http://www.austnet.org/" TARGET=_top>http://www.austnet.org/</A>. It is also up to you to make
sure your austnet.org e-mail address is always correct by contacting
the AustNet CEO, or whoever is delegated to maintain the e-mail aliases
at the time.

<P>

Occasionally a time and date will be set for conferences and training
sessions. You are expected to attend, or else you are required to
contact the ASD HOD and give reasons to your absenence <B>in advance</B>. The
same applies should you be on leave for an extended period, otherwise
access suspension or removal may occur.

<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Abuse</B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

Any ASD Operator caught abusing their access will be dealt with
harshly. All cases of abuse should be sent to <A HREF="mailto:abuse@austnet.org">abuse@austnet.org</A> or the
current ASD HOD with relevant logs and information supporting the case. 
All mail sent to these addresses is treated as strictly confidential.
