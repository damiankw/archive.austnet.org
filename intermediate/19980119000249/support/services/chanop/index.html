<ul>
ChanOP (also known as the Channel Operator) is quite simply, an IRC robot. It
is <b>not</b> a real person, it is an automated service that ensures channel
integrity and protection from malicious takeover attempts.  The ChanOP service
allows users to register their channels and maintain a secure method of
issuing operator status amongst the channel.  More than a mere "bot", ChanOP
is also a server, effectively allowing it to maintain every aspect of your
channel according to your wishes.<br><br>
ChanOP is run by the ASD (AustNet Services Department), a group of volunteers
who devote their time to assisting users with services.
<br><br><ul><li>
If you need online support from the ASD, simply:
<br><tt>/join #Help</tt>  (while connected to an AustNet server)
</li></ul>
<ul><li>
If you need to mail the ASD, they can be contacted at <tt><a href="mailto:services@austnet.org">services@austnet.org</a></tt>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>
If you wish to participate in the ASD, simply mail <tt><a href="majordomo@austnet.org">majordomo@austnet.org</a></tt> with the body

<ul>

ChanOP monitors who receives operator priviliges on all registered
channels. It also has the ability to unban, kick and deop users on request,
and has inbuilt automated facilities that ensure correct channel usage.

</table>
<ul>
ChanOP differs from other bots simply because it is not a bot.  ChanOP is a
server.  AustNet servers
are built with special functions that dissallow users kicking and banning
ChanOP from channels. It also has special privilidges that allow it to gain
operator status on any channel. It can not be flooded nor nick-collided off IRC.<br><br>

ChanOP's completely automated channel registeration eliminates the
lengthy application process found on other networks.  ChanOP is easy to use,
very responsive, and above all provides seamless channel security that
other IRC network's bots cannot always provide.

</table>
<ul>
ChanOP is a service provided by AustNet, it is not a piece of software
available for distribution. ChanOP is part of an IRC process generated by a
50Mb+ program for Unix called "AustNet services", written by Roger Yerammsetti.  This
program acts as a pseudo-server called services.austnet.org, running on
a 200MHz Pentium with 128Mb RAM and a 3.2GB HDD.  It consumes on average
5% CPU and 16-20Mb RAM.  ChanOP is one of the many services that this
program provides, so essentially you do not "get" a ChanOP.  Rather,
ChanOP has the ability to sit on or off thousands of registered channels.
If you would like ChanOP to monitor your channel, you must first register it.
<br><br>
<ul><li>Firstly, check to see if the channel you are interested in
is already registered:<br><br>
<tt>/msg ChanOP info #[channel]</tt>
<br><br>
   This will display information about the channel in question if
   it is registered, if it is not, you will be told so.<br><br>
</li></ul><ul><li>
  Registration is done quickly, to do so, simply:<br><br>
<tt>/msg ChanOP register #[channel]</tt>
</li></ul>
</ul>

<font size=2><A NAME="1.5"><B>1.5 What channels are legible for ChanOP?</a></b></font></td></tr>
</table>
<ul>
ChanOP will not allow illegal content channels to be registered. At the
time of writing, ChanOP will not allow any <tt>#*warez*</tt> channels to
be registered.  If this genre of channel was permitted to be registered,
we would be legally bound by endoursing such activities, consequently, we
must at all times disclaim any legal liability against such channels and
therefore must not allow them to be endorsed by our services.
</ul>

<font size=2><A NAME="1.6"><B>1.6 Can I register more than one channel?</a></b></font></td></tr>
</table>
<ul>
Due to AustNet's "first in first served" channel registration policy,
we do not permit any users to register more than one channel.  If this was
the case, we would find ourselves with next to no channels left for
registration by other users.  Consequently, we have a <b>strictly one
channel per user</b> policy.  Channel ownership is cross-referenced monthly
against nickname userhosts, and we review how many channels a particular
userhost has registered frequently.  If we do find that a userhost has
registered more than one channel, via registering more than one nickname,
we will simply terminate registration for those channels and ban that
userhost from registering any further channels.  <b>You have been warned</b>.

<ul>
Simply mail the ASD at <tt><a href="mailto:services@austnet.org">services@austnet.org</a></tt>,
stating the nature of your complaint, the email addresses and nicknames of
those who support your complaint.  If the complaint is found to be legitimate,
the ASD will suspend the channel's registration, and action will be taken to
resolve any pending issue.

If you are the owner of a channel, it is your responsibility to promote
channel growth, configure your channel for operation and to add users to your
channel access database.  You may wish to review the "<a href="/support/services/chanop/managers/">Channel Managers FAQ</a>".

</table>
<ul>
Each registered channel has a userlist.  This list contains nicknames of
people who have been given certain privilidges on the channel.  An access
level is indicative of what privilidges each user has.  Access levels
range from 0 to 200, where 0 is no access, and 200 is the Channel Manager
access.  In order to execute certain commands through ChanOP, you must have
the required access level.
</ul>

<font size=2><A NAME="2.2"><B>2.2 How do I receive access to a channel?</a></b></font></td></tr>
</table>
<ul>
Access to a certain channel is issued by the Channel Manager and his or her
delegated trusted channel operators (that is, anyone above 150 access). If
you wish to receive access to a channel, you should speak with the channel
manager directly, or with an existing channel operator.
</ul>

<font size=2><A NAME="2.3"><B>2.3 How do I know if I have access?</a></b></font></td></tr>
</table>
<ul>
Generally speaking, if you have access, you should know.  However, to confirm
your access level to a specific channel, simply use the following command:
<br><br>
<ul><li>
<tt>/msg ChanOP access #[channel]</tt><br>
<i>This command will return your access level on the specified channel</i><br>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<font size=2><A NAME="2.4"><B>2.4 I have access, what can I do with it?</a></b></font></td></tr>
</table>
<ul>
You can execute commands through ChanOP based on what access level you
have.  While you are online, simply type the following command to
view your available commands on a specific channel:<br><br>
<ul><li>
<tt>/msg ChanOP commands #[channel]</tt><br>
<i>This will return your available commands</i><br>
</ul></li>
<ul><li>
<tt>/msg ChanOP help [command]</tt><br>
<i>Will show you online help for a specific command</i><br>

<font size=2><A NAME="2.5"><B>2.5 How do I use basic commands through ChanOP?</a></b></font></td></tr>
</table>
<ul>
The following basic commands allow you to execute very simple tasks within
a channel, including kicking, banning, issuing and removing operator status
and changing the topic.<br><br>
<ul><li>
<b>Kick a user from a channel:</b><br>
<tt>/msg ChanOP kick #[channel] [nickname] [reason]</tt><br><br>
</ul></li>
<ul><li>
<b>Ban a user from a channel:</b><br>
<tt>/msg ChanOP ban #[channel] [nickname]|[userhost] [reason]</tt><br><br>

<tt>/msg ChanOP unban #[channel] [nickname]|[userhost]</tt><br><br>
