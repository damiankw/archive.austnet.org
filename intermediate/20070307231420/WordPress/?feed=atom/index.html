		<content type="text/html" mode="escaped" xml:base="http://austnet.org/WordPress/?p=4"><![CDATA[<p>You may of have recently heard that AustNet.org is shutting down, we can confirm that this is not true.  Unfortunately, various members of our admin team decided that they wanted to seperate from the network and fork off to start their own network.  This is completely understandable, and we wish them the best of luck.  What we do not approve of was the way in which this was done, and their trickery through FUD to get users to move to their new network.  Therefore, the word on the street that you may of have heard that we were shutting down was simply false.  They have been attempting to lure the AustNet.org userbase through fear.  We can certainly confirm that we are not closing our doors, and as it stands right now, we are simply working towards restructuring the network after this blatent attack.  Please bare with us as we rearrange the network and we will most likely experience a few technical difficulties here and there.  Nevertheless, onwards and upwards and thanks again for all your support over the years.</p>
<p class="information">For those users confused or concerned about any misinformation recently received, please visit #Help or #ASD online.  You are able to easily connect to the official AustNet IRC servers by simply typing <strong>/server irc.austnet.org</strong> for international users, and <strong>/server au.austnet.org</strong> for Australian users.</p>
