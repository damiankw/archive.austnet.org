<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

This document outlines the rules and regulations that govern the
AustNet. It represents the wills and support of a mass majority of the
AustNet community (users, opers and admins alike). It discusses the
policy and guidelines which are enforced on the network, educating and
promoting proper network usage.

<P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Operators</B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

<UL>
  <LI>Use of /KILL should be limited to providing a quick disruption of
      a broken or errored client or one that is flooding or breaking
      server rules or abusing other servers/clients. This includes or
      could include a K:Line (local) or G:Line (network wide). 

  <P>

  <LI>Client disconnection from the network is substantiated when: 
  <UL>
    <LI>violation of organisation charter agreement occurs 
    <LI>disruption of user's ability to IRC (harassing) 
    <LI>abuse of services or channel takeovers 
    <LI>flooding or clonebots 
    <LI>deliberate ban evasions 
    <LI>damage to servers, connections or physical hardware 
  </UL>

  <P>

  <LI>Use of /SQUIT should be used only to reroute a server or in some
      cases jupe a server in co-operation or support of other online
      IRC-operators or admins. 

  <P>

  <LI>Before using /SQUIT, an operator is required to
  <OL>
    <LI>WALLOP the reroute with the online operators
    <LI>/msg $.austnet.org to inform the general community. 
  </OL>

  <P>

  <LI>Online operators are expected to have general knowledge about
      IRC; if a user asks a question (basic help), operators are
      expected to politely attempt to help. If you find you are
      otherwise occupied, feel free to forward clients to #Help. 

  <P>

  <LI>In the case of reroute or deliberate service interference,
      operators should /msg $*.austnet.org (or relevant server masks)
      in order to notify clients of the upcomming events. 

  <P>

  <LI>General abuse or hassles with operators or servers should be
      presented to the server's administrator, and/or the
      abuse response unit (abuse@austnet.org). 

  <P>

  <LI>An operator can have only one primary O-line at a time. This is
      considered to be their main server, and the one they use the
      most. This is also the person who is responsible for their
      duties. 

  <P>

  <LI>An operator, however, can have as many secondaries as desired.
      These are not listed in server MOTD's and the operator must help
      the admin/oper contact maintain an accurate list of primaries and
      secondaries. 
</UL>

<P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Server Administrators</B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

<UL>
  <LI>The owners/administrators of IRC servers are required to keep
      their server on-line to the requirements of server applications. 

  <P>

  <LI>They are required to maintain and housekeep their server,
      upgrading the daemon when required and ensuring that the server
      is running at optimum performance. 

  <P>

  <LI>Report outages, connectivity upgrades or the like to the Routing
      Department (routing@austnet.org) 

  <P>

  <LI>Server administrators are required to give network administration
      prior knowledge of O-line generation on servers at least 48 hours
      before hand. This is for administrative purposes, and so mail
      aliases, server information and the appropriate resources can be
      modified. This too, serves as a method of monitoring the operator
      count network wide and the ability for discussion over the
      O-line. 

  <P>

  <LI>It is the responsibility of admins to see that their operators
      get the training required to perform well. 

  <P>

  <LI>Any more than four O-lines (primary) on a server is highly
      discouraged unless there is a serious problem on the server that
      requires further monitoring. 

  <P>

  <LI>Server administrators are required to organise connection lines
      with the Routing Department (routing@austnet.org) 

  <P>

  <LI>The server administrator is able to upgrade the server's machine
      or link, providing the machine remains in the same location,
      net-wise, or making other changes as necessary in keeping his or
      her server in the best possible working condition, where "best
      possible working condition" is defined at the discretion of the
      administrator. 

  <P>

  <LI>Setting up an additional server to expand the capability of the
      site, even if this includes running additional processes on
      different machines, providing that the machines are of comparably
      capability, and the server's location does not change. 

  <P>

  <LI>Do whatever is necessary regarding his or her own server, to be
      decided at the administrator's discretion, to make a smooth
      transition during hardware or software upgrades, or during an
      emergency situation. 

  <P>

  <LI>An administrator is responsible for the actions of their
      operators. If an operator causes problems which the administrator
      cannot or will not deal with, the administrator/operator
      contact will ask the administrator to suspend the operator until
      the matter can be resolved. 
</UL>

<P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Services Operators</B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

<UL>
  <LI>Network Operators (100 service access) should attempt to mediate
      problems such as channel takeovers and channel floods, using the
      SETMODE and WIPECHAN commands. 

  <P>

  <LI>Issuing operator status to certain users should be done
      <B>only</B> when a channel has lost ops for a reason <B>and</B>
      channel users are unhappy about it <B>and</B> they have decided
      upon who is to be opped. 

  <P>

  <LI>A WIPECHAN should be used when a channel has been locked and set
      to +pstmil 1 or such similar mechanism (such as +b *!*@*)
      <B>and</B> channel regulars complain about it. In this case, the
      channel has to be cleared and nothing else. Ops will be decided
      as usual by the person who joins the channel first. 

  <P>

  <LI>Service Operators (200 service access) are required to assist
      users in the legitimate recovery of passwords to their nickname. 

  <P>

  <LI>Service Operators, in the case of channel or service abuse, are
      required to use the SUSPEND command to stop the management of a
      certain channel temporarily. 

  <P>

  <LI>Channel suspension or removal as a disciplanary action should be
      posted to services@austnet.org as well to inform the network of
     channel management modifications. 

  <P>

  <LI>Service Operators reserve the right to remove channel
      registrations when services have been abused. This is most likely
      the case when an operator on a channel registers the channel, and
      they are not supported by the current fellow operators. This is
      considered a channel takeover and should be investigated in
      depth. 
  <P>

  <LI>All IRC Operators are not subject to addition of service access. 
</UL>

<P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Voting Policy</B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

<UL>
  <LI><B>Vote Roll</B><BR>
      All AustNet Administrators and global IRC Operators are given the
      option to vote for issues as they arise. Voting is a priviliage,
      and is subject to your vote participation. Voting will be handled
      by AustNet's vote server VoteOP.

  <P>

  <LI><B>Vote Participation</B><BR>
      Anyone on the vote roll who does not vote for 3 votes in a row,
      may be subject to removal from that vote roll. (exceptions are
      those who are known to be away for a period of time). We need
      each and every vote, as most are often close, therefore having
      inactive voting members wastes time in having to call revotes. 

  <P>

  <LI><B>Vote Procedure</B><BR>
      Only those with level 300 access to AustNet services may place a
      vote, however admins may approach one of these people to request
      a vote for an issue they feel needs addressing.

      <P>

      When a vote is placed, VoteOP will send a 'note' to all members
      on the voteroll, and an email shall be sent to the AustNet
      general mailing list [austnet@austnet.org] advising of this.

      <P>

      Members on the voteroll shall place their vote before the vote
      closing date.

      <P>

      When the vote closes, any votes made will be processed, a summary
      shall be posted to the AustNet general mailing list, and full
      vote details will be made available on AustNet's website. 


  <P>

  <LI><B>Vote Results</B><BR>
      Any abstain's made in a vote shall not be taken into account when
      deciding what the majority was. A votes outcome is determined
      only by the YES and NO votes. A clear 50% or higher majority is
      required either way.

      <P>

      In event of a vote not having any clear outcome, a revote shall
      be called in 1 weeks time. This revote shall not allow any
      abstain votes to be made (to try to force some type of majority
      towards YES or NO).

      <P>

      In the event of a revote being a tie, the CEO shall decide the
      outcome of that vote. 

  <P>

  <LI><B>Vote scenarios</B><BR>
      <U>Testlink vote:</U>
      <UL>
        <LI>On event of a YES, server shall be given permanent AustNet
            server status. 
        <LI>On event of a NO, server shall be delinked and may re-apply
            to be a server on AustNet after a period of waiting 2
            weeks.
       </UL>

      <U>o: to O: vote:</U>
      <UL>
        <LI>On event of a YES, administrator has support of network to
            modify the person's o: into an O:. However, this is still
            the administrators choice, and may choose not to do that
            immediatly. The administrator may remove o:/O: lines
            anytime they wish without need for votes. 
        <LI>On event of a NO, the administrator is given option of
            leaving the person as an o: for a while (as the
            administrator does not have the network support to upgrade
            that status). The administrator may choose to drop that
            person as an o: too. A vote may not be called regarding 
            that person's oper status until a period of 2 weeks has
            passed.
