-=- What is ircG? -=-=-

   The Internet Relay Chat Gateway is a project started by the
   AustNet IRC Network in an attempt to link the various networks
   out there, without them having to sacrifice DNS/Services/Netname
   which usually must be comprimised on a link.

-=- So? What does it do? -=-=-

   Basically, it is a gateway between networks. You can message users
   on another network, without having to be online there. ircG reroutes
   your message to the appropriate network depending on who you sent
   the message to.

-=- Oh, so I can talk to all my friends on different networks? -=-=-

   Not exactly. You may only send messages to those who are on 
   networks that are linked up. If ircG isn't on a network you want
   it to be on, talk to the administrators of that network about
   it :-)

-=- Ok, so how do I talk to my friends? -=-=-

   Firstly, you yourself must connect to the gateway. This makes your
   nick visible on all the other linked networks. To connect:

        /msg GateWay connect

   You will get a message back saying if the connect was successful,
   and the nickname you will be visible on the other networks.

-=- Whooa, firstly, Who is GateWay? -=-=-

   Gateway is the interaction service between user and ircG. It is a
   common nick on all networks. GateWay has a few commands available
   to it.

        /msg GateWay help

-=- Ok i getcha, now it changed my nick when i connected, that right?? -=-=-

   Yes indeed. To avoid complications of nick collisions, as well as to 
   make gateway'd nicknames easily identifiable, your nick is modified
   slightly. If your nick is greater than 6 letters long, it only uses
   the first 6. The last 3 letters are used for your tag.

   eg.  Original Nick          Gateway Nick (assuming client on AustNet)
        Sam                    Sam|AU
        RogerY                 RogerY|AU
        SeEcReT                SeEcRe|AU

   The |AU last 3 letters is reserved for the tag.

-=- Tag? -=-=-

   Yup. This identifies what network you signed on from. It is in format

        |TOKEN   when TOKEN is a 2 letter abbreviation of the network
                 you connected from. For a listing of networks and their
                 tags/tokens:

        /msg GateWay list

    -> *gateway* list
    [Gateway] *** Start of currently linked networks
    [Gateway]    Token     Network  Total Users  Gateway Users
    [Gateway]  1    AU     AustNet         1322              6
    [Gateway]  2    OZ       OzOrg         2143              9 
    [Gateway] *** End of list. /msg Gateway list [network]

-=- Wow, list even says how many gateway users are on -=-=-

   It does. If you are interested in seeing who is on from a particular
   network, try doing this:

        /msg GateWay list <network | token>

    -> *gateway* list au
    [Gateway] *** Start of gateway clients on AustNet
    [Gateway]      Gateway Nick  Original Nick                 On Server
    [Gateway]   1     SeNtiN|AU       SeNtiNaL    voyager.nz.austnet.org
    [Gateway]   2        k-j|AU            k-j    voyager.nz.austnet.org
    [Gateway]   3     gyliun|AU         juliet aussie.nsw.au.austnet.org
    [Gateway]   4     RogerY|AU         RogerY firstlink.nsw.au.austnet.org
    [Gateway]   5     SeecsY|AU         SeecsY wantree.wa.au.austnet.org
    [Gateway]   6     Gremli|AU        Gremlin firstlink.nsw.au.austnet.org
    [Gateway] *** End of list

-=- I dont know if my friend is online over elsewhere. Can i check? -=-=-

   Yup. If you have a fair idea what the users nickname is on another
   network, try doing the following.

        /msg GateWay whois nickname@network

   Substitute 'network' for the network name OR the token (shown on the
   LIST command)

    -> *gateway* whois rogery@au
    *** RogerY is ensign@firstlink.nsw.au.austnet.org (Today is a gift, 
        Thats why its called THE PRESENT)
    *** on irc via server firstlink.nsw.au.austnet.org (First Link's 
        Sydney AustNet Server)
    *** RogerY is an IRC Operator
    *** RogerY has been idle 49 seconds 
    *** RogerY has been on-line 1 day 14 hours 17 seconds
    *** rogery : End of /WHOIS list.(from AustNet.AU)

-=- My friend is over there! But I sent message, says No such nick... -=-=-

   You may only message someone on another network IF they have connected to
   ircG already. You may send a request to them asking to connect to the
   ircG. This is called 'paging' them.

-=- Page? Do explain -=-=-

   Ok, once you realise that your friend is over on another network, and they
   havn't already connected to the ircG, you can ask GateWay to send a request
   to them to connect.

        /msg GateWay page nickname@network

   Substitute 'network' for the network name OR the token (shown on the
   LIST command). 

    -> *gateway* page rogery@au
    [Gateway] rogery has been paged on AustNet 

   RogerY would then see...
    [Gateway] Woger (Woger|OZ) has requested that you sign yourself onto this 
              network's gateway.
    [Gateway] To signon type: "/msg Gateway connect" or send a message to 
              Woger|OZ which will auto sign you on

   If they want to go ahead and connect to ircG, then they simply have
   to either

        /msg GateWay connect

   or    send a message to your gateway'd nickname (for auto connection).

-=- Auto connection huh? -=-=-

   Yes, in an attempt to make life easy :-)

-=- Teehee, this means I can 'PAGE' flood my enemies ;-) -=-=-

   Think again :-)  You are limited to one page per minute. We do think ahead
   you know ;-)

-=- You know, there are some very naughty users out there. Im going
    to be flooded !!! -=-=-

    Nonsense! ircG has flood protection built in :-)

    CTCP/DCC's are limited to 5 per minute. PRIVMSG/NOTICES are considered 
    flooding if you send 15 messages in 7 seconds.

-=- No fair, oh well, I can still bother the users with those restrictions -=-=-

   Maybe for a short while, but each network has a special access list, where
   these users can put masks on ignore!

        /msg GateWay ignore add nick!user@host
        /msg GateWay ignore del nick!user@host
        /msg GateWay ignore list

   Thus, you may use the gateway on other nets, but if your host matches the
   ignore list for this net, well you are blocked from sending messages to 
   this network.

-=- Bah, but ircG does make a great tool to use when im GLINE/AKILL'd from
    a certain network *evil smile* -=-=-

   Teehee, do you think we are really that dumb? Any GLINE/AKILL that ircG
   receives is added to the ignore list automatically for the network :-)

-=- No fair! Anything you havn't thought of? -=-=-

   Maybe, drop us a line :-)  This is all in an effort to have ircG a 
   service which can be enjoyed, not a mechanism for war/floods.

-=- So why is it different to linking 2 networks directly? -=-=-

   IRCG allows for PRIVMSG's and NOTICES to be transfered from one
   network to another. It has advantages over a real physical ircd
   server linking the two, since not ALL of one nets burst data is
   sent to the other network. Only a few things are sent. This keeps
   each network effectivly set apart. See below for what the gateway
   listens for and what it transmits to other networks.

-=- Uhh hang on, I wont be receiving another networks data? -=-=-

   No, there is no need for each network to be told everything about
   the other networks. Only the gateway would receive the burst of
   other nets.

-=- So what exactly will ircG receive and send? -=-=-

   Well, ircG will receive everything your network sends out, since 
   it connects to your network as a SERVER (virtual). Thus it will
   receive anything that your servers send it. However, it only 
   listens for certain things, it will ignore the rest. What it does
   listen for is NICK (USER), MODE, PRIVMSG, SERVER, SQUIT, QUIT,
   CONNECT, NOTICE, PING, PONG, MOTD, GLINE, AKILL, RAKILL, STATS, 
   KILL, VERSION, PASS

   These are common commands which are required to interact with clients
   as well as keep an internal representation of state of network.

   ircG sends out the following. NICK, QUIT (for gateway'd nicks), 
   SERVER, SQUIT, WALLOPS, PRIVMSG, NOTICE. ircG will NOT send out
   kills, nor will it oper. It does not nick-collide either (unless
   its uplink is very lagged, and sends out a NICK which it thought
   was correct before receiving updated data.)

-=- Ummm, is ircG only compatible with a certain ircd source tree :/ -=-

   No silly :) Every network, no matter what ircd they run, should
   get a chance. We support networks who have a range of nick sizes
   too, from 9 characters to whatever yours is :)

   Current irc daemon formats supported are...
     * ircu 2.9.*  [Undernet]
     * ircu 2.10.* [Undernet] (SUPPORT SOON. BUT NOT CURRENTLY)
     * dal  4.4.*  [DALnet] (Previous DALnet versions supported possibly)
     * ircd 2.8.*  [EFnet] (NICK/USER methods supported as well as NICK)
     * ircd 2.9.*  [IRCnet]
     * CR   1.*    [Confroom]

   If your favourite format isn't listed here, drop me a line at 
   gateway@austnet.org with details about it, and where i may download
   source OR the syntax formats for PASS/SERVER combination so I may
   telnet into the server, and see what syntax's it uses :)

-=- Cool, sounds ok. So where do I download ircG? -=-=-

   The source nor the binary is publically available. It is kept
   under lock and key :-)

-=- Huh? If I cant download it, how to I run it to link up? -=-=-

   You do not need any of ircG's software. ircG only needs a C/N
   pair on your network. It will then connect as a server.

-=- Ok, so then how do I get c/n pairs for gateway? -=-=-
   Email the following to gateway-apply@austnet.org and a gateway
   representative will get back to you either by email or online.
