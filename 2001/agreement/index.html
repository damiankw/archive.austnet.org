By continuing your connection to the AustNet IRC network, and its subsequent
servers, you agree to the following conditions.

<B>If you do not, disconnect now and do not reconnect.</B>

We do not accept ignorance as an excuse, and we will remove clients from our
network that do not adhear or agree to the conditions set out below:

* Flooding is not tolerated on the AustNet network. Any violations of this rule
  will result in banning your site and often entire domain from the
  network.  

* Clones are not tolerated on the AustNet network. Any violations of this rule
  will result in banning your site and often entire domain from the
  network.

* IRC is an unmoderated medium.  No AustNet server, staff member or provider
  logs or scrutinize the traffic which passes through the servers. We take no
  responsibility, and explicitly disclaim any legal liability for the content
  of any messages which pass through any AustNet server, and the consequences
  of running any commands you do as a result of being "on IRC".

* IRC may not be suitable for children.  Please supervise your child's IRC
  session.

* We reserve the right to change rules without warning or prior notice.

* Upon connection to our network, you give us express permission to connect to
  your host for verification.  This is done via ident/auth lookups on port 113,
  and insecure wingate proxy on both ports 23 and 1080.

* We reserve the right to deny access to this server to any users without the
  need for warning nor explanation.
