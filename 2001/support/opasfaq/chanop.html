<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

ChanOP (also known as the Channel Operator) is quite simply, an IRC
robot. It is <B>not</B> a real person, it is an automated service that
ensures channel integrity and protection from malicious takeover
attempts.  The ChanOP service allows users to register their channels
and maintain a secure method of issuing operator status amongst the
channel.  More than a mere "bot", ChanOP is also a server, effectively
allowing it to maintain every aspect of your channel according to your
wishes.

<P>

ChanOP is run by the ASD (AustNet Services Department), a group of
volunteers who devote their time to assisting users with services.

<P>

      to an AustNet server)

</UL>

<P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B><A NAME="2">How does it protect channels?</A></B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

ChanOP monitors who receives operator priviliges on all registered
channels. It also has the ability to unban, kick and deop users on
request, and has inbuilt automated facilities that ensure correct
channel usage.

<P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B><A NAME="3">How does it differ from other bots?</A></B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

ChanOP differs from other bots simply because it is not a bot. ChanOP
is a server.  AustNet servers are built with special functions that
dissallow users kicking and banning ChanOP from channels. It also has
special privilidges that allow it to gain operator status on any
channel. It can not be flooded nor nick-collided off IRC.

<P>

ChanOP's completely automated channel registeration eliminates the
lengthy application process found on other networks.  ChanOP is easy
to use, very responsive, and above all provides seamless channel
security that other IRC network's bots cannot always provide.

<P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B><A NAME="4">How do I get myself a ChanOP?</A></B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

ChanOP is a service provided by AustNet, it is not a piece of software
available for distribution. ChanOP is part of an IRC process generated
by a 50Mb+ program for UNIX called "OPAS", written by
<A HREF="mailto:rogery@austnet.org">Roger Yerammsetti</a>. This
program acts as a pseudo-server called services.austnet.org, running
on a Pentium II 300 MHz with 128Mb RAM. It consumes on average around
30Mb RAM and is hosted by
<A HREF="http://www.fl.net.au/" TARGET=_new>First Link</A> in Sydney.
ChanOP is one of the many services that this program provides, so
essentially you do not "get" a ChanOP.  Rather, ChanOP has the ability
to sit on or off thousands of registered channels. If you would like
ChanOP to monitor your channel, you must first register it.

<P>

<UL>
  <LI>Firstly, check to see if the channel you are interested in
      is already registered:

      <P>

      <FONT SIZE="3"><TT>/msg ChanOP info #[channel]</TT></FONT>

      <P> 

      This will display information about the channel in question if
      it is registered, if it is not, you will be told so.

      <P>

  <LI>Registration is done quickly, to do so, simply:

      <P>

      <FONT SIZE="3"><TT>/msg ChanOP register #[channel]</TT></FONT>
</UL>

<P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B><A NAME="5">What channels are legible for ChanOP?</A></B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

ChanOP will not allow illegal content channels to be registered. At
the time of writing, ChanOP will not allow any <I>warez</I> or
<I>child pornography</I> channels to be registered.  If this genre of
channel was permitted to be registered, we would be legally bound by
endorsing such activities, consequently, we must at all times disclaim
any legal liability against such channels and therefore must not allow
them to be endorsed by our services.

<P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B><A NAME="6">Can I register more than one channel?</A></B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

Due to AustNet's "first in first served" channel registration policy,
we do not permit any users to register more than one channel.  If this
was the case, we would find ourselves with next to no channels left
for registration by other users.  Consequently, we have a <B>strictly
one channel per user</B> policy.  Channel ownership is
cross-referenced continuously against nickname userhosts, and we
review how many channels a particular userhost has registered
frequently.  If we do find that a userhost has registered more than
one channel, via registering more than one nickname, we will simply
terminate registration for those channels and ban that userhost from
registering any further channels. <B>You have been warned</B>.

<P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B><A NAME="7">How can I complain about ChanOP being on a channel?</A></B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

Simply mail the ASD at
<a href="mailto:services@austnet.org">services@austnet.org</a>,
stating the nature of your complaint, the email addresses and
nicknames of those who support your complaint.  If the complaint is
found to be legitimate, the ASD will suspend the channel's
registration, and action will be taken to resolve any pending issue.

<P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B><A NAME="8">I've registered my channel, now what?</A></B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

If you are the owner of a channel, it is your responsibility to
promote channel growth, configure your channel for operation and to
add users to your channel access database.

<P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B><A NAME="9">What is ChanOP access?</A></B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

Each registered channel has a userlist.  This list contains nicknames
of people who have been given certain privilidges on the channel.  An
access level is indicative of what privilidges each user has.  Access
levels range from 0 to 200, where 0 is no access, and 200 is the
Channel Manager access.  In order to execute certain commands through
ChanOP, you must have the required access level.

<P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B><A NAME="10">How do I receive access to a channel?</A></B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

Access to a certain channel is issued by the Channel Manager and his
or her delegated trusted channel operators (that is, anyone above 150
access). If you wish to receive access to a channel, you should speak
with the channel manager directly, or with an existing channel
operator. Should you be given access, you will probably be required to
confirm your access (you will have "Pending" next to your nick in the
channel access list). Information about confirming your access can be
found by <A HREF="noteop.html">reading your notes</A>. 

<P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B><A NAME="11">How do I know if I have access?</A></B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

Generally speaking, if you have access, you should know. However, to
confirm your access level to a specific channel, simply use the
following command:

<P>

<UL>
  <LI><FONT SIZE="3"><TT>/msg ChanOP access #[channel]</TT></FONT><BR>
      <I>This command will return your access level on the specified
      channel</I>
</UL>

<P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B><A NAME="12">I have access, what can I do with it?</A></B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

You can execute commands through ChanOP based on what access level you
have.  While you are online, simply type the following command to view
your available commands on a specific channel:

<P>

<UL>
  <LI><FONT SIZE="3"><TT>/msg ChanOP commands #[channel]</TT></FONT><BR>
      <I>This will return your available commands</I>
  <LI><FONT SIZE="3"><TT>/msg ChanOP help [command]</TT></FONT><BR>
      <I>Will show you online help for a specific command</I>
</UL>

<P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B><A NAME="13">How do I use basic commands through ChanOP?</A></B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

The following basic commands allow you to execute very simple tasks
within a channel, including kicking, banning, issuing and removing
operator status and changing the topic.

<P>

  <LI><B>Kick a user from a channel:</B><BR>
      <FONT SIZE="3"><TT>/msg ChanOP kick #[channel] [nickname] [reason]</TT></FONT>

      <FONT SIZE="3"><TT>/msg ChanOP topic #[channel] [topic]</TT></FONT>
</UL>

<P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B><A NAME="14">Can I have 2 or more people with level 200 access in my channel?</A></B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

No, there can only be 1 owner per channel. By giving a user an access
level of 190 or above, they have access to exactly the same commands
as the channel owner, except the "drop" command. However, even if you
were allowed more than 1 person at a level of 200, they would not be
able to access this command anyhow (there is a difference between the
channel "owner" and someone with level 200 access). Some channels do
have more than 1 person at level 200. This is because they were added
before we made every command available to users with an access level
of 190 or more.
