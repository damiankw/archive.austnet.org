<P align="center">Come join the journey of the <b>Starship Enterprise.</b> Our mission is to chat about anything and everything. We are the original and largest Star Trek channel 
on Austnet and our crew are a diverse group with a 
wide range of talents ranging from great communication 
skills to Scripting and IRC/MIRC help.
So come visit our channel chat we are always looking 
for new Starfleet personnel or perhaps just browse 
and download from our 43mb StarTrek and assorted sci-fi
Sound File Library.</P>
