Thousands of people around the world connect through the Internet to
the Relay Chat, a popular communication method of the 20th century.
Originating in 1988, the concept of the Relay Chat has grown to the
forfront of Internet participation and continues to expand alongside 
the information technology revolution.

<P>

Looking for an alternative to the lag, splits and politics of DALnet,
the takeovers of EFnet, and the time it takes to register a channel on
Undernet? Then its time for you to give AustNet a try!

<P>

AustNet is based upon the principle of an efficient, secure and well
developed network that allows users to own their channels and  actively
participate in the growth of an International network. Founded in
<B>Australia</B>, AustNet has rapidly expanded through <B>Canada</B>,
<B>Singapore</B>, <B>New Zealand</B>, <B>Europe</B>, the <B>United
States</B>, and now <B>Taiwan</B>, providing international coverage, with high quality
servers. AustNet experiences minimal lag and netsplits and provides
exceptional public services.

<P>

Featuring superior technical innovations, AustNet excels in client 
services and online help.

<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Why AustNet?</B></FONT>
<HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#FF0000">

AustNet is an international network that aims to be rid of server
splits, political fatigue and nuking that ruins other IRC networks -
finally a network that allows users to enjoy IRC.

<P>

In doing so, we offer technical innovations individual to our network.
These include:</P>

<UL>
  <LI><B>ChanOP</B> (Channel Registration)<BR>
  The channel operator service allows users to register their channels
  and maintain a secure method of issuing operator status. More than a
  mere "bot", ChanOP is a server, allowing it to operate from inside or
  outside the channel.  This service allows the channel owner(s) the
  ability to keep their channel open <B>24 hours</B>.

  <P>

  <LI><B>NickOP</B> (Nickname Registration)<BR>
  The nickname registra controls who has authorisation to use certain
  nicknames. Upon connecting to <B>any</B> AustNet server, your
  nickname is verified with NickOP and if it is not yours, you are
  given the option to authenticate yourself or use another nickname.
  AustNet was the first known IRC network to implement a function for
  services to <B>force a nick change</B>, unlike other networks, which
  disconnect you if you fail to authenticate. NickOP has speedy
  registration facilities.

  <P>

  <LI><B>Minimal netsplits and lag</B><BR>
  AustNet servers are positioned strategically and are not normally
  subject to the lag and splits that plague other networks.  The
  network does not have an "open" server link policy, and new servers
  are voted in based on their performance. 

  <P>

  <LI><B>Friendly and ethical network operators</B><BR>
  AustNet network operators, or IRC Operators, are trained to the
  highest standards to meet the user's demands.  Unlike other IRC
  networks, IRC Operators at AustNet are required to act according to
  a strict code of ethics.

  <P>

  <LI><B>Server innovations</B><BR>
  AustNet servers are based and located in the most suitable positions
  world wide. Alongside the well managed topology, servers run the most
  innovative server software of any network.  Merging latest patches,
  combining the powerful code of other genres of IRCd, and developing
  our own code; AustNet's IRC daemon is acclaimed to be one of the most
  "technically superior" available. This gives you, the user, a better
  connection to the AustNet than any other network. Features include
  long nicknames (15 characters), full topic and mode synchronisation,
  the ability to display or hide channels without users, faster data
  bursting, anti-spam measures, in-channel services commands, long
  topics, and the world-first <B>Virtual World</B> to finally disperse
  nuking on IRC.
