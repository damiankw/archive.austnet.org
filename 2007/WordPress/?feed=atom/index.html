<p>In order to change your ident, you need to do the following:</p>
<p>These instructions are for mIRC users.</p>
<p>Type <strong>//identd on $me </strong>then <strong>/quit</strong> the IRC server and then rejoin, this should fix the problem.</p>
<p>However sometimes it may have something to do with your email that has been set.  If that&#8217;s the case, you need to fix that aswell. This can be done with this command in mIRC.</p>
<p><strong>/emailaddr email@address.ok </strong></p>
<p>Changes the email address in the Connect dialog - then you can disconnect from the server with <strong>/quit</strong> and then reconnect to the server and hopefully you would be able to change your ident.</p>

<p>LoveOp, after nearly 10 yrs has called it quits. She decided to hang up her wedding dresses, her flowers and garters and run off with GameOp.</p>
<p>So #chapel and #loveop are now closed down for renovations; Netpriests have been defrocked.</p>
<p>GameOp functions have been moved to ChanOp. When you type in `8ball Your question here - ChanOp will reply - Example is below.</p>
<p>:Vapid: `8ball Am I alive?<br />
:ChanOp: 8ball: Am I alive??? Never.!!</p>
<p>As further changes are tested and implemented, more shall be revealed.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://austnet.org/WordPress/?p=18"><![CDATA[<p align="left">As AustNet now has mode +R, many channels have set it, so that only registered users who have identified to NickOP can access these channels. We have had many questions from users who do not know how to use services, how to register their nicks, and how to identify to them.</p>
<p align="left">To REGISTER your nickname you must follow the instructions below. Please keep in mind that these are instructions with examples.</p>
<p align="left">1: Think of a password, and write it down somewhere safe.<br />
The password must be minimum 6 characters long, with a mix of numbers and letters</p>
<p align="left">2: Use your real email address.<br />
If you lose your password for your registered nick, ASD staff can send the password direct to your email address, with instructions on how to identify to your nickname.</p>
<p align="left">3: Register your nickname.<br />
If you are using mIRC, then please ensure you follow these instructions, and look at the screenshots below.</p>
<p align="left">Query nickop to read the instructions.</p>
<p align="left">Type /query nickop help</p>
<p align="left"><a href="http://img259.imageshack.us/img259/3267/step1nc2.jpg">STEP 1 CLICK HERE</a></p>
<p align="left">Switch to the Main AustNet Status screen, nickop will send you notices, and look for the instructions. Then type out your command to register, as seen below we have used:</p>
<p align="left">/msg nickop REGISTER purpler41n immonfire@gmail.com <strong><font size="1">|| THIS IS AN EXAMPLE ONLY</font></strong></p>
<p align="left"><a href="http://img259.imageshack.us/img259/2128/step2ub7.jpg">STEP 2 CLICK HERE</a></p>
<p align="left">When you press enter, confirmation shows up in the Status screen that your nick is registered, the host, and that you have set mode +R</p>
<p align="left"><a href="http://img259.imageshack.us/img259/853/step3am6.jpg">STEP 3 CLICK HERE</a></p>
<p align="left">Now you can join any channel you wish.</p>
<p align="left">In addition, we do have many users who keep registering new nicknames, due to the current message being sent</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">EG: #sydney:You need a registered nick to join that channel, please see #ASD.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">This is leading to many users registering excessive nicknames, which is unnecessary. Users of Austnet are permitted only 4 nicknames per PERSON. ASD staff members are now deleting excessive nick registrations, and placing bans on addresses to stop further registration of nicks, and a message for the user to come into #ASD to learn how to identify.</p>
<p align="left">What users need to do, is to remember to IDENTIFY as the nicknames they have set up previously.</p>
<p align="left">You need to type the following when you next log into AustNet, otherwise you can&#8217;t join registered channels:</p>
<p align="left">Ensure you are on the AustNet Status screen, and then attempt your IDENTIFICATION.</p>
<p align="left">/msg nickop@austnet.org IDENTIFY purpler41n<strong><font size="1">||THIS IS AN EXAMPLE ONLY</font></strong></p>
<p align="left"><a href="http://img258.imageshack.us/img258/741/step4cz3.jpg">STEP 4 CLICK HERE</a></p>
<p align="left">Once you have entered in your username and password, you should get a message from nickop that would look similar below, and a line that states mode: +R has been set.</p>
<p align="left"><a href="http://img258.imageshack.us/img258/8688/step5mp9.jpg">STEP 5 CLICK HERE</a></p>
<p align="left">If you find you are still having difficulties, feel free to join #ASD and ask questions from our helpers.</p>
